['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'subsequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Clover made a sort of wall round them with her great foreleg, and the ducklings nestled down inside it and promptly fell asleep. At the last moment Mollie, the foolish, pretty white mare who drew Mr. Jones's trap, came mincing daintily in, chewing at a lump of sugar. ||| She took a place near the front and began flirting her white mane, hoping to draw attention to the red ribbons it was plaited with. Last of all came the cat, who looked round, as usual, for the warmest place, and finally squeezed herself in between Boxer and Clover; there she purred contentedly throughout Major's speech without listening to a word of what he was saying.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| There were only four dissentients, the three dogs and the cat, who was afterwards discovered to have voted on both sides. Major continued:      "I have little more to say. ||| I merely repeat, remember always your duty of enmity towards Man and all his ways. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| He seized the gun which always stood in a corner of his bedroom, and let fly a charge of number 6 shot into the darkness. The pellets buried themselves in the wall of the barn and the meeting broke up hurriedly. ||| Everyone fled to his own sleeping-place. The birds jumped on to their perches, the animals settled down in the straw, and the whole farm was asleep in a moment.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The work of teaching and organising the others fell naturally upon the pigs, who were generally recognised as being the cleverest of the animals. Pre-eminent among the pigs were two young boars named Snowball and Napoleon, whom Mr. Jones was breeding up for sale. ||| Napoleon was a large, rather fierce-looking Berkshire boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way. Snowball was a more vivacious pig than Napoleon, quicker in speech and more inventive, but was not considered to have the same depth of character.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', None] ||| Can you not understand that liberty is worth more than ribbons?   Mollie agreed, but she did not sound very convinced. ||| The pigs had an even harder struggle to counteract the lies put about by Moses, the tame raven. Moses, who was Mr. Jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| But they woke at dawn as usual, and suddenly remembering the glorious thing that had happened, they all raced out into the pasture together. A little way down the pasture there was a knoll that commanded a view of most of the farm. ||| The animals rushed to the top of it and gazed round them in the clear morning light. Yes, it was theirs - everything that they could see was theirs!
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Napoleon sent for pots of black and white paint and led the way down to the five-barred gate that gave on to the main road. Then Snowball (for it was Snowball who was best at writing) took a brush between the two knuckles of his trotter, painted out MANOR FARM from the top bar of the gate and in its place painted ANIMAL FARM. ||| This was to be the name of the farm from now onwards. After this they went back to the farm buildings, where Snowball and Napoleon sent for a ladder which they caused to be set against the end wall of the big barn.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| And not an animal on the farm had stolen so much as a mouthful. All through that summer the work of the farm went like clockwork. ||| The animals were happy as they had never conceived it possible to be. Every mouthful of food was an acute positive pleasure, now that it was truly their own food, produced by themselves and for themselves, not doled out to them by a grudging master.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'accordingly'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| First came the hoisting of the flag. Snowball had found in the harness-room an old green tablecloth of Mrs. Jones's and had painted on it a hoof and a horn in white. ||| This was run up the flagstaff in the farmhouse garden every Sunday-morning. The flag was green, Snowball explained, to represent the green fields of England, while the hoof and horn signified the future Republic of the Animals which would arise when the human race had been finally overthrown.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| She was telling them that all animals were now comrades and that any sparrow who chose could come and perch on her paw; but the sparrows kept their distance. The reading and writing classes, however, were a great success. ||| By the autumn almost every animal on the farm was literate in some degree. As for the pigs, they could already read and write perfectly.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'accordingly'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| He said that the education of the young was more important than anything that could be done for those who were already grown up.  It happened that Jessie and Bluebell had both whelped soon after the hay harvest, giving birth between them to nine sturdy puppies. As soon as they were weaned, Napoleon took them away from their mothers, saying that he would make himself responsible for their education. ||| He took them up into a loft which could only be reached by a ladder from the harness-room, and there kept them in such seclusion that the rest of the farm soon forgot their existence. The mystery of where the milk went to was soon cleared up.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'the reasons isare that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Most of this time Mr. Jones had spent sitting in the taproom of the Red Lion at Willingdon, complaining to anyone who would listen of the monstrous injustice he had suffered in being turned out of his property by a pack of good-for-nothing animals. The other farmers sympathised in principle, but they did not at first give him much help. ||| At heart, each of them was secretly wondering whether he could not somehow turn Jones's misfortune to his own advantage. It was lucky that the owners of the two farms which adjoined Animal Farm were on permanently bad terms.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'later'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Snowball, who had studied an old book of Julius Caesar's campaigns which he had found in the farmhouse, was in charge of the defensive operations. He gave his orders quickly, and in a couple of minutes every animal was at his post. ||| As the human beings approached the farm buildings, Snowball launched his first attack. All the pigeons, to the number of thirty-five, flew to and fro over the men's heads and muted upon them from mid-air; and while the men were dealing with this, the geese, who had been hiding behind the hedge, rushed out and pecked viciously at the calves of their legs.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'subsequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The animals had now reassembled in the wildest excitement, each recounting his own exploits in the battle at the top of his voice. An impromptu celebration of the victory was held immediately. ||| The flag was run up and Beasts of England was sung a number of times, then the sheep who had been killed was given a solemn funeral, a hawthorn bush being planted on her grave. At the graveside Snowball made a little speech, emphasising the need for all animals to be ready to die for Animal Farm if need be.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', None] ||| For some weeks nothing was known of her whereabouts, then the pigeons reported that they had seen her on the other side of Willingdon. She was between the shafts of a smart dogcart painted red and black, which was standing outside a public-house. ||| A fat red-faced man in check breeches and gaiters, who looked like a publican, was stroking her nose and feeding her with sugar. Her coat was newly clipped and she wore a scarlet ribbon round her forelock.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'specifically'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| It had come to be accepted that the pigs, who were manifestly cleverer than the other animals, should decide all questions of farm policy, though their decisions had to be ratified by a majority vote. This arrangement would have worked well enough if it had not been for the disputes between Snowball and Napoleon. ||| These two disagreed at every point where disagreement was possible. If one of them suggested sowing a bigger acreage with barley, the other was certain to demand a bigger acreage of oats, and if one of them said that such and such a field was just right for cabbages, the other would declare that it was useless for anything except roots.  Each had his own following, and there were some violent debates.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| He was closeted there for hours at a time. With his books held open by a stone, and with a piece of chalk gripped between the knuckles of his trotter, he would move rapidly to and fro, drawing in line after line and uttering little whimpers of excitement. ||| Gradually the plans grew into a complicated mass of cranks and cog-wheels, covering more than half the floor, which the other animals found completely unintelligible but very impressive. All of them came to look at Snowball's drawings at least once a day.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Electricity, he said, could operate threshing machines, ploughs, harrows, rollers, and reapers and binders, besides supplying every stall with its own electric light, hot and cold water, and an electric heater.  By the time he had finished speaking, there was no doubt as to which way the vote would go. But just at this moment Napoleon stood up and, casting a peculiar sidelong look at Snowball, uttered a high-pitched whimper of a kind no one had ever heard him utter before. ||| At this there was a terrible baying sound outside, and nine enormous dogs wearing brass-studded collars came bounding into the barn. They dashed straight for Snowball, who only sprang from his place just in time to escape their snapping jaws.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Every Sunday morning at ten o'clock the animals assembled in the big barn to receive their orders for the week. The skull of old Major, now clean of flesh, had been disinterred from the orchard and set up on a stump at the foot of the flagstaff, beside the gun. ||| After the hoisting of the flag, the animals were required to file past the skull in a reverent manner before entering the barn. Nowadays they did not sit all together as they had done in the past.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The animals lashed ropes round these, and then all together, cows, horses, sheep, any animal that could lay hold of the rope - even the pigs sometimes joined in at critical moments - they dragged them with desperate slowness up the slope to the top of the quarry, where they were toppled over the edge, to shatter to pieces below.  Transporting the stone when it was once broken was comparatively simple. The horses carried it off in cart-loads, the sheep dragged single blocks, even Muriel and Benjamin yoked themselves into an old governess-cart and did their share. ||| By late summer a sufficient store of stone had accumulated, and then the building began, under the superintendence of the pigs. But it was a slow, laborious process.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'subsequently'] ||| ['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', None] ||| He intended to take the whole burden upon his own shoulders. A Mr. Whymper, a solicitor living in Willingdon, had agreed to act as intermediary between Animal Farm and the outside world, and would visit the farm every Monday morning to receive his instructions. ||| Napoleon ended his speech with his usual cry of "Long live Animal Farm!" and after the singing of Beasts of England the animals were dismissed. Afterwards Squealer made a round of the farm and set the animals' minds at rest.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The human beings did not hate Animal Farm any less now that it was prospering; indeed, they hated it more than ever. Every human being held it as an article of faith that the farm would go bankrupt sooner or later, and, above all, that the windmill would be a failure. ||| They would meet in the public-houses and prove to one another by means of diagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down, or that if it did stand up, then that it would never work. And yet, against their will, they had developed a certain respect for the efficiency with which the animals were managing their own affairs.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| You did not suppose, surely, that there was ever a ruling against beds? A bed merely means a place to sleep in. ||| A pile of straw in a stall is a bed, properly regarded. The rule was against sheets, which are a human invention.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', None] ||| The little floating island is now attached to the world from which it was once quite free. A bond united them, even in the very heart of the watery wastes of the Atlantic. ||| That bond is the wireless telegraph, by means of which we receive news in the most mysterious manner. We know full well that the message is not transported by the medium of a hollow wire.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We know not whom you are, whence you came, your birth and breeding--all is a mystery to us. Three years ago you appeared in our midst as Arsène Lupin, presenting to us a strange combination of intelligence and perversion, immorality and generosity. ||| Our knowledge of your life prior to that date is vague and problematical. It may be that the man called Rostat who, eight years ago, worked with Dickson, the prestidigitator, was none other than Arsène Lupin.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| But the outlines of that creature, who was no longer Arsène Lupin, assumed a more definite form. He came toward me, growing larger and larger, leaped into the compartment with incredible agility, and landed squarely on my chest. ||| With a cry of fright and pain, I awoke. The man, the traveller, our companion, with his knee on my breast, held me by the throat.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Mon. Valorbe then asked to see Henriette. They went to her apartment; she was sewing, whilst her son Raoul, about six years old, was sitting beside her, reading. ||| The commissary was surprised to see the wretched apartment that had been provided for the woman. It consisted of one room without a fireplace, and a very small room that served as a kitchen.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The preliminary inquiry was very brief, and disclosed nothing. There were no papers in the pockets of the deceased; no name upon his clothes; no initial upon his linen; nothing to give any clue to his identity. ||| The room was in the same perfect order as before. The furniture had not been disturbed.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'even though'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| But, at the end of a few minutes, he had the disagreeable impression that he was being followed. Turning around, he saw a man skulking amongst the trees. ||| He was not a coward; yet he felt it advisable to increase his speed. Then his pursuer commenced to run; and he deemed it prudent to draw his revolver and face him. But he had no time.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'differentcon'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| It is a system, a unique system, whose great advantage lies in combining a network comprising over 800 qualified advisers with an efficient portal, facilitating easy data access and interactive data exchange.  Since 2006 the EURES portal has offered easy access to all of the job offers in the European Union as well as to the national public employment services in the countries belonging to the European Economic Area in 25 European languages.  On average the portal offers access to more than 1 200 000 offers. At the same time the EURES advisers are on hand to help workers and their families who are planning to make use of the opportunities that mobility offers. ||| I would now like to answer your questions one by one. I will start with your first question concerning the possible expansion of EURES to third-country nationals.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The European Court of Justice also stated that interpretation of the relevant national legislation does not fall within its competence. It is entirely for the Greek courts to provide an interpretation of relevant Greek legislation and to determine whether this legislation complies with the requirements of the Directive regarding the existence of effective measures that would prevent and sanction abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts. ||| Greece implemented the above-mentioned Directive through Presidential Decree No 164/2004 concerning the public sector. The Commission carried out a thorough analysis of this Decree and concluded that it was compatible with the requirements of the Directive.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I want to state that the factual grounds that gave rise to these reasoned opinions vary of course from country to country as does their gravity. In any event, 14 states have received these reasoned opinions. ||| 2007 is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and it has given the public authorities and civil society an incentive to organise actions and campaigns focusing on the benefits of diversity and non-discrimination. The fight against discrimination must constantly be at the forefront of our mind. In 2008 the Commission will submit proposals for the European Year of Equal Opportunities follow-up programmes: these may contain measures for finalising the framework of anti-discrimination legislation.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'considering this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  Firstly, I would like to say that unfortunately at present we do not have as yet at our disposal comparable data that provides a good basis for a reliable European strategy. ||| Acquiring data that can be interpreted as such is one of the Commission's goals. We also have to realise that the debate you started and the issue you mentioned are very closely connected to the debate on services, on generally beneficial social services.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for instance'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| You are well aware of the fact that this Parliament and the EU as a whole has adopted climate change as one of the principal challenges for the period ahead and it is well known that water shortage and advancing desertification are incontrovertible consequences of climate change. I am amongst those who are convinced that we should be preparing for the impact of climate change, rather than desperately attempting to arrest it, because our efforts in that direction are likely to fail. ||| Today we know as a matter of certainty that Europe, particularly its southern regions, will have to cope with water shortages and soil degradation. Climatological debates teach us that atmospheric water loss causes further desertification, which in turn is responsible for further climate warming. Breaking out of this vicious circle will prove to be very difficult.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'for example'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| As a result, the Committee on Budgets examined the draft budget very carefully. Unfortunately, it turned out that the combined draft budget presents numerous problems and is very ambiguous. ||| The main problem is that the funding was not explicitly included in the multi-annual financial framework for 2007-2013: the sum involved is EUR 308 million. There are doubts about a further EUR 1.5 billion given the proposal to finance the Institute from other programmes, in particular the Structural Funds and the Seventh Framework Programme for Research.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'bearing this in mind'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  Social exclusion is caused by a wide range of factors, and it would be a great pity not to use this report for follow-up work. ||| In my speech I would like to stress the importance of public services and their contribution to eliminating poverty and exclusion. Once privatised, public services will become more expensive and less accessible.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| This should always be pointed out. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for a very intensive debate which, although short, has helped to enrich the concept of flexicurity. ||| Allow me to thank the rapporteur especially. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'to provide some background information'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The report, unlike the Commission's document, contains many concrete proposals and recommendations as to how to achieve better results in the field of health and safety at work. I am pleased that the rapporteur is also stressing the need to define cancer correctly and to express cancer numerically as an occupational disease, to specify the targets for the reduction of this severe disease. ||| Up to now only 5% of cancer cases caused by work were classified as an occupational disease. I have greatly welcomed the incorporation in the report of my amendment, which I tabled in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the need to secure for the general public free access to technical norms.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I had the opportunity to visit several production plants in the food industry in different countries. These plants are very similar, despite their geographical diversity. ||| The men hold the managerial jobs and the unskilled work on the production line is done by women. They earn little, they work mechanically in a stupefying rhythm, without any motivation for professional growth, and they work under unfavourable conditions.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'more generally'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Is not the real issue of stationing the radar in the Czech Republic also about gaining advantage? Even a layman can understand what warriors had known long before Hannibal: a shield in a soldier's hand is a means for a better and more efficient use of his sword. ||| The talk is about increased security but is the issue not really about increasing security risks? It is only logical that we will immediately become target number one for potential adversaries.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'considering this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The European Research Area, discussed here endlessly, is a very good idea and a very good vision. However, there is still a long way to go before it becomes a reality. ||| Talking is not enough. We also have to assess how it functions and indeed whether it functions at all. Being a Member of this Parliament who represents a new country, I know from my own experience that at this stage the European Research Area is only an illusion and wishful thinking.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'considering this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| As the rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Development, I regret the increase in the number of irregularities detected in projects financed from Structural Funds.  This reflects negatively on some Member States and their internal control mechanisms. Difficulties on the part of these countries should not, however, become a reason to re-evaluate the existing system of decentralised controls governing the use of Structural Funds. ||| The responsibility is evident; it is individual and as such it also has to be enforceable. Attaining an appropriate level in financial control mechanisms in individual Member States is the first necessary step.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| It will be a headache for these countries' diplomats, as they grapple with the task of navigating the criticisms contained in the report. I think that for future reference it would be appropriate to separate the resolution and explanatory report. ||| I would like to quote the example of one of the countries in question, Kazakhstan. At the end of 2006 the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbajev, came to Brussels. I think that the Commissioner was present with us at the time.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The EU's first priority is the use of the natural resources of those countries, namely oil, natural gas and uranium. Another priority is blocking one of the main channels of opium smuggling from Afghanistan. ||| This brings us to the direct responsibility of the EU and the US for supporting the establishment of authoritarian regimes in the countries in that region. The individual countries try to limit the proliferation of terrorist groups and the spread of militant Islamic ideas, but such a situation has a negative effect on the development of civil society and participative democracy and tends to support the rule of force.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for instance'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| It must be stressed, however, that global problems such as infectious diseases and biodiversity can only be solved successfully with the participation of these countries. African politicians are aware of this and are doing their best to make science and technology a priority. ||| The African Ministerial Conference on Science and Technology held in September 2005 adopted a new Consolidated Plan of Action for NEPAD, the New Partnership for Africa's Development. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  The European Union recognises the importance of that access, as it will enable the continent of Africa to cope with the challenges of climate change. ||| The Commission believes that African countries must urgently develop the necessary complex strategies for adaptation, while making sure that such changes do not jeopardise the positive results these countries have achieved in their fight against poverty. The Commission feels that our cooperation in the field of science and technology is especially important as regards research into agriculture and the monitoring of agricultural products. The Commission therefore supports the efforts of the African Union to establish a complex programme of scientific research in the area of agriculture and the endeavour of international organisations to harmonise agricultural early warning systems.  We also support the transfer of renewable energy technology, which is an issue closely related to the reduction of CO2 emissions. However, this transfer should focus more on efforts to attain a sustainable and efficient energy supply and on access to the supply, rather than the issue of climate change.  A very important role in the context of technology transfer is played by the private sector, which the Commission supports through a specific programme.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I consider this development to be extremely important. We must not forget that Belarus itself is still struggling with the extremely serious consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. ||| Present trends in mutual relations reveal that a certain view of Belarus has taken hold among the political circles of the European Union and that view is very critical and one-sided. We need not just criticism but also cooperation.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', None] ||| So that not only myself but also many other Members of this Parliament can raise their hands in favour of the result of the conciliation procedure, I want to hear a clear answer to my question. Commissioner, Monsieur le Commissaire, c'est pour vous: since the new Regulation does not guarantee a common procedure for testing pilot safety, how will this issue be solved once Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 is abolished? ||| Can you confirm that the European Cockpit Association and the Commission have agreed on the preparation of a regulation establishing a common procedure for testing pilot safety? If yes, when will this text be presented?
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'nothing no direct relation'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  What once looked impossible is now a reality. ||| This Parliament, the European Parliament, united in its recommendation to both the Council and the Commission on the European Union's role in Iraq. Let us bury the past.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'even though'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| These dependents are generally the children of female prisoners. Mothers with one child account for more than half of all women imprisoned in Europe. ||| The exact numbers differ from country to country, as do prison conditions. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| There are a number of reasons for this: as we know, the population is ageing and more and more people are exposed to carcinogens. According to the trade unions, at least 8% of annual cancer deaths are directly caused by exposure to carcinogens in the workplace. ||| We have to bear in mind that one in three Europeans is diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and one in four Europeans dies from the disease. Another important matter is the significant differences in cancer treatment success rates between the old and new Member States.  This imbalance is surely also food for thought.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| A globalised world globalises our lifestyles and ways of working. Multinational companies have turned our cities into a common marketplace so that sometimes we do not know whether we are in Paris or in Prague. ||| As far as I am concerned, we have now had quite enough. Culture has a place in the soul of a nation and roots in its place of origin.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  I would like to stress the importance of the contribution by Mrs Barsi-Pataky, whose expertise and diplomatic tact helped to negotiate the renewed referral. ||| I am saying this too as a participant in the trialogue with the Council and the Commission that was led, in my opinion with great success, by Mrs Niebler on behalf of Parliament. This is not my first time speaking here about Galileo.  Like before, I do not deny that this is a project that is not only ambitious and costly, but also- or exactly for that reason- controversial for several of my colleagues in my group.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| While the police in all countries make sure, as part of their duties, that politicians or members of parliaments can carry out their work, the French police tries to prevent the Members of the European Parliament from working. At the entrance to this institution a policeman banned me from entering, even after having seen my permit, allegedly in order to protect a demonstration taking place outside the entrance to Parliament. I think that this is scandalous and I hope that this matter will be debated in Parliament. ||| Of course this is not relevant to my question but let me tell you that I would not be speaking here now had I not run around to another part of the building. I was entitled, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to put a question to both the Council and the Commission concerning the forthcoming meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and Biosafety in Bonn.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  It is difficult to say which of the three has been worst. ||| During his visit Mr Saakashvili shared with us just one thought: he encouraged us to buy Georgian wines, which he called 'wines of freedom'. I am not sure whether, for example, Stalin's preferred wine, Chvanchkhara wine, can be considered such; in any case the situation in Georgia is serious.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The Commission therefore invited them to the negotiations on the European Works Councils. The European Trade Union Confederation stated at the end that it was unable to open negotiations on the European Works Councils with the employer organisations. ||| On behalf of the Commission, I invited the social partners once again to make every effort to improve the framework for these activities. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'considering this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  I accepted the proposal that I should deputise for him with pleasure, inter alia because much of what falls within my competence is closely related to sport. ||| I would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent report that he and his colleagues in Parliament have spent six months preparing. I am convinced that the report is a balanced document and deals with all the relevant themes.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| However, I would like to say a few things and reply to some questions. In my opinion, it is clear from the debate what a complicated phenomenon sport represents in the life of a modern society. ||| The other thing which I am pleased to say is that, following the vote on Mr Mavrommatis's report, we will have a very solid base for Europe's forthcoming coherent policy on sport: a base grounded in the White Paper and Parliament's report. Understandably, the debate has revealed a whole range of thoughts, which it will be necessary to take up and begin work on in the near future.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', None] ||| Human rights are indivisible and must be protected by all constitutional systems throughout Europe, in all Member States. Each Member State must comply with this and make adequate efforts to fulfil this duty. ||| There is another thing I want to mention in this context. This morning we debated poverty and social exclusion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'to provide some background information'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  The ambitious plan to launch a satellite system for the Galileo navigation satellite system is sufficient proof of this. ||| All satellite-based systems should use in communications the same radio spectrum from 1980 to 2010 MHz and 2170 to 2200 MHz. It makes sense that this resolution is trying to unify the fragmented regulations of the individual countries in a uniform framework, and to set up a unified operating methodology for communication frequency assignment.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| This country has been a candidate country since 1963.  Conditions for opening negotiations have been discussed all the time. The so-called Copenhagen criteria, laid down in 1993, cannot be found in the opening preambles of the text. ||| When we sink our teeth into the European Commission's Turkey 2007 progress report, we find out that, although some progress has been made, the legislation adopted in regard to national minorities has not yet been sufficiently implemented. The fact that approximately 10% of the Turkish population capable of work are employed in the countries of the EU is an indicator of the depth of the long-standing relations between Turkey and the EU.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The argument that their harmful effects have not been proven sounds totally absurd to anyone who has ever seen the consequences of their use. Dirty bombs will shatter into pieces the several centimetre thick armour plates of the most modern tanks. Their destructive power is enormous. ||| They have an impact on people's health. They kill without mercy.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| It will help to ensure that the people affected by poverty and social exclusion are perceived in a different light. The Commission has always insisted that this concept, this approach must be preserved in the text. ||| I think that most of the amendments tabled by the European Parliament go in that direction. 
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| In my opinion, this is a very important aspect. Enlarging the eurozone to include another country, Slovakia, will definitely lead to deeper European integration. It will not be just the Slovak Republic but also the European Union as a whole that will benefit from this deeper integration when this very successful and fast-developing economy joins. ||| Fears of inflation were mentioned in the debate. Of course, in some ways these fears are justified. On the other hand, there are equally potent arguments proving that the Slovak Government is consistent in its response and, at any rate, it is not in the interest of any government to set off inflation.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for instance'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Although the President of the European Parliament, Mr Pöttering, declared that the aim of the Treaty was to achieve greater democracy, greater political effectiveness and greater clarity and transparency, and that the ratification process must continue in those Member States that have not yet ratified it, these are just meaningless phrases. Had referenda taken place in countries other than Ireland, the Irish 'no' would surely not have been the only one. ||| Take the trickery employed by the 'European elite' who presented nothing more than the dusted and amended EU draft Constitution for ratification! In addition to the Irish, the French and the Dutch would say 'no' again; after all, public opinion surveys carried out in these countries indicate as much.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', None] ||| Consequently, we need new measures. Road safety is determined not just by vehicle safety and the quality of driver training, but also by the state of the infrastructure, meaning the safety of road construction and road markings. ||| Most existing measures concentrate on vehicle safety, while some attempt to influence driver training and eliminate those that may be dangerous to other road users, for example through the points system. Not much has been done so far in relation to the method of improving road infrastructure at European Union level.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Recently I saw photographs of public executions in Iran. Believe me, they are among the worst things I have seen in my life. My Group, the GUE/NGL Group, is using the European Parliament to call on the Islamic Republic of Iran to cease executions with immediate effect, especially the executions of people who committed a criminal offence when they were juveniles. ||| Under Mr Ahmadinejad, Iran has long been sending not just mass murderers to the gallows but also people who have committed acts that in developed countries receive much lighter punishments or are not even considered to be against the law. The country must review its understanding of the law and modify it to ensure that human life is respected.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'specifically'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  For the fourth time in this House, we have the opportunity to talk about the situation of the Roma in Italy. ||| I believe that everyone in this House, across the political spectrum, will agree that the situation of the Roma needs to be resolved through immediate and appropriate measures to overcome the social, economic and humanitarian crisis. The Commission was alarmed to read in the press that the Italian authorities were taking fingerprints from people living in 'nomads' camps' with which to create a database.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The implementing regulation sets out how Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, which we call the basic Regulation, should operate. It extends to all persons who make use of the coordination of national social security systems: citizens, Member States'social security institutions, health care providers and employers. ||| Its goal is to establish procedures, as clearly as possible, on the basis of which those insured persons who are in a cross-border situation will receive social benefits. Who do I turn to in order to be granted family benefits?
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'bearing this in mind'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Citizens will now have to wait for the new directive on cross-border health care to be adopted, although reimbursement of costs is part of this regulation. In addition, the directive will not make a significant contribution in the area of subsidiarity in health care but adopting the policy may be delayed, perhaps for years. ||| I regret that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs underestimated this angle. Apart from that, the report is very good and I will support it. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Since 1994 the Commission has financed worldwide approximately 30 projects, the total monetary value of which is roughly EUR 15 million. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner categorically expressed her opposition to the death penalty, whether actually used in practice or set out in legislation, in a public declaration on 10 October 2007, on the occasion of the World Day Against The Death Penalty, and on other subsequent occasions. ||| The incident, which is the subject of the letter written by the Member of this House, is known to the Commission. Iraq is one of the countries to which the European Commission often sends demarches on the use of the death penalty.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in particular'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  In accordance with Article 22 of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 this card is valid for a temporary stay, whatever its purpose: tourism, employment or study. ||| If the holder of this card is in need of health care during his stay, the card entitles him to receive this health care from medical staff. The European Health Insurance Card covers its holders for 'essential health care'.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| As has been said already, the renewed social agenda was discussed by Ministers for Labour and Social Affairs at an informal meeting of the Social Council held in early July at Chantilly. I was pleased to receive a report on the very positive welcome of the renewed social agenda by Member States and I await with interest the conclusions which the Council should receive by the end of this year. ||| I have already had the opportunity to present this package to the Conference of Presidents and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. A suitable time has also arisen for an in-depth debate here in Parliament.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Apart from the problem of combustion of a methane-hydrogen mixture, something which I know about since my dissertation concerned combustion, it would be necessary for normal engines to also use urea to achieve clean combustion products in accordance with EURO 5 to 6 for the elimination of nitrogen oxides. One of the objectives of the European Union is to expand the use of hydrogen in transportation in the near future and there should be dramatic growth by 2020. ||| It is true that the technical problems associated with the storage and handling of hydrogen require clear, unified regulations, including the labelling of systems working with hydrogen. I fully agree with the rapporteur on this.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in short'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  Surprisingly, here in the EU we are once again experiencing those things that we were convinced we had left behind long ago. ||| It is strange case of déjà vu. I lived through the entire communist era in my country, during which our lives were carefully divided into years, months, weeks and days, each dedicated to someone or something.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  Individual Member States view such investigations and the determination of technical causes as an essential component of accident reduction. ||| The only exception up to now has been maritime transport. There are of course some framework regulations, but maritime transport and shipping are far more complex than other types of transport when it comes to establishing which state is to be responsible for investigating the causes of accidents.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'bearing this in mind'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] |||  Health is a prerequisite for a happy life and for a successful society. ||| It is necessary to constantly repeat and emphasise that caring for our own health and for the health of those who are close to us is a personal responsibility of each one of us. Health is the result of our genetic heritage, of the lifestyle and environment in which we live.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We need a unified set of administrative rules for all drugs on the internal market, in order that we can prevent negative impacts on human health. I therefore warmly welcome the aim of this proposal to ensure that all drugs on the market are subject to the same criteria, including those drugs that have been approved purely at a national level. ||| I would like to consider the question of purely national registration in more detail. Even though I was a supporter of unified criteria with no exceptions, I believe that the text of proposed amendment number 36, allowing national regulations to continue in use for drugs that have been registered at a purely national level and approved prior to 1 January 1998, should not be an obstacle to harmonisation at a European level as it is so well thought-out and provides sufficient guarantees, such as the requirement to inform the Commission of decisions to continue with the application of national regulations or the requirement for transfer to European regulations where a drug has already been registered in another Member State.  Regarding the implementation of a single application covering one or more identical changes, I feel that it would bring a certain measure of relief to the large pharmaceutical companies, which is surely a good thing.  I am not quite so sure, however, that the positive effect will be to reduce the administrative burden in the individual Member States.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'despite this'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| The Commission Communication of July 2007 stated that Community laws were effective in eliminating direct discrimination- in other words in cases where the remuneration for the same work is lower for women than for their male colleagues. They were, however, less effective in ensuring adherence to the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. ||| Based on a detailed analysis the Commission has concluded that it should be possible to consider amending Community law with the aim of ensuring above all that the systems for setting pay rates exclude both direct and indirect gender-based discrimination. The Commission announced that in 2008 it would be evaluating Community laws from the standpoint of their implications in respect of the pay gap and that it would be proposing necessary amendments.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', None] ||| I have received requests for help, not only from our 20 000 strong federation of winegrowers but also from the federations of winegrowers in Spain, France, Italy and Germany which belong to the Assembly of European Wine Regions (AREV). The Commission, however, has had the temerity to turn a blind eye to this. ||| The DG AGRI insisted that it knew nothing and that winegrowers were happy. And now that Commissioner Boel has conceded that winegrowers are not happy, she tells us that nothing can be done.  Something can actually be done, however, because we are the Parliament.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Does it involve the Fourth Geneva Convention? It does not. ||| We are carelessly anticipating here the negotiations of a future peace conference, without having any right to do so. The head of the delegation to Palestine was drawn into visiting a lawfully convicted family, thereby inciting the extreme provocation of Israeli officials, out of which has come a resolution which, unfortunately, will achieve nothing.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'considering this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| There was a clear message that the overall aim must be to integrate the Roma fully into the economic, social and cultural life of Europe and to ensure equal opportunities for everyone in the EU, including Roma. Civil society must be fully engaged in this partnership. ||| It follows from this that the Roma must participate in proposing, implementing and monitoring policies which apply to them. The Commission therefore welcomes the contribution made to the summit by non-governmental organisations, for example the declaration from the EU Roma Policy Coalition.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'considering this'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| Our Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats was prepared to support fully the socialists' report, including the socialists' amendment proposals.  It was the socialists themselves who refused to vote on their own report. The report has nevertheless been passed by the Committee for Foreign Affairs, it is on the table and it is essential to vote on the report within the lifetime of this Parliament. ||| Our group is fully determined to debate and adopt the report. That which took place today damages Europe.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'likewise'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| It is no accident that I have chosen a medieval monarch as an example of our links with France and with European values. Charles IV, in his policies, could not uphold a narrowly Czech stance; on the contrary, he had to integrate and represent a whole diverse empire. ||| In a sense, the European Union follows on from this medieval universalism- if nothing else, in the fact that it prefers a common moral code and common legal basis over local power interests. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for example'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  I take the view that the Czech Presidency is an opportunity for us to help overcome the existing division of Europe into West and East. ||| In his novel Schweik, Jaroslav Hašek once made a pun, a German-Hungarian pun, kelet oszt, nyugat veszti, which loosely translated means that the East gives and the West takes. Consequently, that is the way history has progressed.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', None] ||| Yet the Czech Presidency is pursuing restrained objectives and sensible priorities, and will be very successful. Let us wish it well and give it our support, despite the embarrassing howls from the Czech Socialists who have long since exchanged love of country for proletarian internationalism, and thus today, on the instructions of their socialist masters, venomously seek to destabilise the Czech Presidency. ||| I could not care less! The plot is for the Czech Presidency to demonstrate that small countries are inept and that it is time permanently to hand over the reins of the Union, via the Treaty of Lisbon, to the large, capable and experienced countries.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I am proud to have been part of that, and to be standing here today, and it seems incredible to me that the Czech Republic now holds the presidency of a community which has a population of nearly half a billion and comprises as many as 27 countries. If the European Union loses the capability- leaving aside the question of rules and unification- for free public discussion, and seeks to unify this discussion too, then it will not be my European Union. ||| If we lose the capability, the possibility of freely expressing our views, it is the road to disaster, and I strongly object to the attacks on Václav Klaus. He has a unique ability to insert his views into this unified and, I would say, over-correct discussion, and thereby set the parameters for fresh discussion.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I would also like to note that the Czech Presidency and I myself, in my capacity as President of the European Council, will be in close contact and will work in close cooperation with the European Commission over the entire six months.  The first fortnight has shown how continuous, daily and very active contact, not only with José Manuel Barroso, but also with the entire Commission, has secured joint action over the issues that descended upon us at the beginning of the year. I am referring here not only to our cooperation with the European Parliament, but in particular to our communication with the European Commission as we sought to handle these ad hoc issues.  I would like to extend my gratitude to President Barroso. Before I came here, I swore I would tell no jokes. ||| The one joke I did tell, which everyone at home would laugh at, fell flat. Never mind, I will keep on trying and perhaps eventually even the German translation will get it right and we will understand one another. The Treaty of Lisbon cannot be a mantra.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for example'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', None] ||| The gas crisis was not triggered by Russia but by Ukraine, and it is not a political problem, but an economic issue. This needs to be made quite clear! The second aspect is the focus (which I have criticised several times in the past) of EU bodies and institutions- and Parliament is no exception- on problems that are irrelevant and only divert attention away from the really urgent issues. ||| This was reaffirmed by the reaction to Russia's legitimate decision to suspend gas supplies. Rather than the embarrassing pampering accorded to the Ukrainian administration as a sort of 'protective filter' between Russia and EU countries and rather than dreaming up the perfect shape for a cucumber, the EU should have been preparing for a crisis of this kind long ago.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Today we are experiencing a fundamental change in the situation. The two decades of the experiment of US domination are coming to an end, to be replaced with a multipolar concept that may also lead to conflict. ||| What we can see going on around us are the events accompany a shift in the distribution of power. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'specifically'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| In recent months the Commission has obtained reports on cases of cruelty to animals. The Commission continues to support the best available options for improving the situation. ||| The ultimate aim is a better enforcement of EU laws and thus, healthier animals and decent living conditions for the relevant animals. A study carried out by the joint research centre concluded that new and more effective control systems, such as monitoring transport with the help of satellite positioning systems, would help to improve the situation and enable a more transparent implementation of the rules.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'this is why'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| This indicates that during the course of civilisation, it has begun to be understood that there is a greater affinity between human beings and animals than between human beings and objects. In my opinion, the development of civilisation has led us to understand that animals are not objects, that they are living beings which have intrinsic rights and we have expressed this view in our laws. ||| I think it can be said that European regulations have now been formulated and that they undoubtedly represent progress for civilisation. On the other hand, the debate has clearly shown that they are not applied consistently and that reasons could be found for further improvements in their structure.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| As concerns the specific question raised by one MEP on the request to have the Mediterranean diet included on the world cultural heritage list of UNESCO, the Commissioner's predecessor, Markos Kyprianou, raised this topic at a Council agriculture meeting in July 2007. The Commission welcomes this initiative, as it can help to encourage healthy eating habits throughout the EU. ||| The European Commission, of course, has no formal powers to support such a request within the framework of UNESCO, since it is not a member of UNESCO and it cannot therefore participate in the decision-making process. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'the reasons isare that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to respond to one speech in particular with which I profoundly disagree. I see no reason why we should reconsider the location of the agency in Finland. ||| I have no doubt that people grouped around the agency there are fully able to defend and fulfil the mandate given to the agency. In my opinion, the location was decided correctly and reasonably.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'bearing this in mind'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Freedom of expression and freedom of the press form part of public affairs administration in the broadest sense of the term and this, in itself, is at the centre of EU development strategy. I frankly take the view that a free and responsible press is an essential precondition for democracy and the legal state, which are integral components for sustainable development. ||| Only on the basis of dialogue will the media and the Kenyan Government be able to develop a common understanding and build mutual respect. Thus, the European Commission looks forward with interest to the results of the various meetings which will take place in Kenya between the parties involved and it hopes that relevant parties will reach agreement on appropriate recommendations for proposals to amend the media law.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| The same applies to the need for a pronounced improvement in energy efficiency (the efficient use of energy) with the broadest possible application of ICT. It is more than obvious that, without the sensible and, I should like to emphasise, considered and most wide-ranging application of these technologies, we shall succeed neither in reducing energy consumption nor in limiting the adverse effects of climate change. ||| With the help of specialised centres, research institutes, representatives of important industrial sectors and state authorities in Member States of the Union, we have attempted to chart the situation regarding the use of ICT for enhanced energy assessment. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| It is therefore clear that an intensive effort to construct nuclear power stations will be necessitated in the very near future. At present this is the only recognised source of clean energy producible on a large-scale but it has its ideological opponents even in the EP. ||| Until thermo-nuclear fusion has been mastered there will be no alternative to nuclear energy when seeking a clean energy source. With this provision I agree with the report.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for instance'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Others attempt to exclude the possibility of maritime disasters occurring. However, despite all technical measures, large-scale accidents can occur. ||| Until the Prestige tanker disaster, the countries of the European Union were unaware of the need for a thorough unification of accident technical investigations in the branch of maritime transport. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'bearing this in mind'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| More than 6 million women in the EU (aged from 25 to 49) say that they are unable to work or can work only part-time because of family obligations. The European economy is thereby deprived of significant productive potential, and this at a time when it must confront serious economic and demographic challenges, and when the social position of families is thereby weakened. ||| The development of childcare facilities for pre-school age children will enable families to decide freely how to organise their time and how to achieve a better work-life balance. The aim is not to 'force' parents to send their children to these facilities.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I would also like to stress that the Barcelona criteria do not involve forcing a single solution on anyone but providing a real choice, a real choice for parents because, ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental point has been made in the debate and in my opinion very clearly in the last contribution, that genuinely attentive and loving parents naturally have a great ability to distinguish how to decide at a given moment, in a given phase of family life, or in a given situation, what will be best for their children. And therefore I believe it is also good to provide choice through the Barcelona criteria. ||| Concerning the question of how the Commission will support the Barcelona criteria, it can be done through the structural funds. In the new perspective, it is explicitly possible for the first time. Previously, it was technically possible but the way was rather unclear and complicated, since this is an open possibility.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  Parents are leaving their home country to work in another Member State- so-called 'mobile workers'- and are leaving their children at home in the care of relatives. ||| These arrangements are supposed to be temporary but it seems that they often become more long-lasting. The question of whether arrangements for children left at home operate on a formal or informal basis depends on the length of time for which the parents intend to work abroad.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The level of unemployment in the EU could be around 10% in 2010. Day after day, companies are announcing restructuring measures or are relocating, often with the loss of many jobs. The situation in the company Qimonda, which has announced the closure of plants in Germany and Portugal, is, unfortunately, not unique. ||| The Commission is aware of the negative effects which restructuring can have on workers, their families and the economic and social structure of a given region. However, I would like to emphasise that the Commission does not have the power to overturn or postpone the decisions of individual companies and that companies are not obliged to inform the Commission of their decisions.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Furthermore, the latest forecasts predict that the number of people unemployed in the EU will rise by almost 3.5 million in 2009. Despite all of the measures adopted to date, unemployment is rising. ||| I am not the only one who thinks that something is wrong. The current situation shows the failure of the policies to date which have mainly supported the accumulation of large profits by large commercial and financial groupings, the creation of huge monopolies and a deterioration in the living standards of workers and ordinary people.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for example'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| EPAs have always been a high priority for development ministries at their meetings within the framework of the Council for General Affairs and External Relations. In recent years almost all of these meetings have included discussions with the Commission on the implementation of the Council mandate concerning EPAs, which have often resulted in the adoption of conclusions. ||| When the Czech Presidency presented its programme to this Parliament in January, we said that this was a key period and we promised to put maximum efforts into ensuring further progress. We took the opportunity to respond to many different questions and we have devoted considerable efforts to a range of topics.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| One of the inspiring meetings providing us with an opportunity for joint discussions on the urban dimension was an event entitled European Urban Day, which I organised together with partners at the beginning of February in Prague within the framework of the Czech Presidency of the EU. I would like at this point once again to thank Commissioner Hübner, Mr Svoboda and my colleagues Mr Olbrycht, Mr Beaupuy and Mrs Kallenbach for their participation and their active approach. ||| It is logical that our attention is focused on cities. Cities are home to 80% of the 500 million or so inhabitants of the EU.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I fully agree that it is essential to uphold the precautionary principle. However, I would also like to point out that in 12 years only 86 applications have been submitted, 28 new food products have been licensed and 3 rejected. ||| The legislation which has applied to date is not very transparent and therefore we are now integrating the procedure for all Member States in this area, thereby simplifying the approval and placing of novel foods onto the market. However, I do not consider the draft report to be very satisfactory.  I am sorry that my fellow Members are unfamiliar with the link to the regulation on genetically modified food products and animal feed.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'even though'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The system quite simply works. Our one major task is to keep the system in operation and to guarantee for EU citizens the same social standards as they had before the crisis. ||| In my opinion this is definitely not a minor task and it will cost a lot of money. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'at which point'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  In 2005 we adopted a resolution on the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. ||| We discovered that the European Parliament and the EU lacked the political will to pursue a common understanding and evaluation of European history. While the victims of Fascism and Nazism have received decent compensation, millions of victims of Communism have been forgotten.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  The radical right needs it also because of the forthcoming elections. ||| It has nothing to do with objective, genuinely independent assessments. There are already enough historical institutes and centres dealing with that.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for instance'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The regional institutions and ordinary people living in this or that territory know best what needs to be done to revive their region. There are many projects whose implementation would represent both a step forwards and an impulse for further action. ||| I come from the region of Northern Moravia, from Silesia, an area where Czech, Polish and Slovak territory all meet. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'despite the fact that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| As far as the proposed amendments are concerned, I agree with many of the improvement suggestions contained in the draft report. Nevertheless I would like to say that this draft requires unanimous consent in the Council and we must therefore remain realistic. ||| I know that the problem of multiple discrimination is fundamental to you. I am fully aware of the fact that people who are victims of multiple discrimination are very seriously affected.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', None] ||| I have to say that this directive, as it has been submitted to the Commission, is one which came into being organically, out of a profound debate in Parliament and countless debates at Commission level and therefore it is a directive which is well thought-out and which expresses a firm and clear approach to values.  It was also said in the debate that non-discrimination is based on values which we applied and which we became aware of after the Second World War. Whether or not it is true that we developed a deeper awareness of the significance and constitutive weight of certain values after the Second World War, these values have very deep historical roots. ||| In antiquity there was no fundamental concept of human equality- the concept was first formulated in the Christian religion. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| In practical terms this means greater protection for all travellers, especially disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, regardless of the means of transport. Moreover, it will create equal conditions for all areas of transport. ||| The Czech Presidency of course welcomes these proposals and attaches great importance to them. I believe we all share the objective adopted by the EU in recent years of reinforcing passenger rights.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The Czech Presidency is fully aware of the important role played by the European Parliament in the legislative process in the area of public health, and it understands that close cooperation between the Council and Parliament is essential. Your reports on these three topics have therefore come at the right time. ||| I would now like to say a few words from the perspective of the Council concerning the proposed directive of the European Parliament and the Council on applying patients' rights in cross-border healthcare. The Czech Presidency is fully aware of the need to provide legal certainty for patients receiving healthcare in another Member State, and it is building on the results of the French Presidency's work in this area.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I can tell you that the opinions of the Council and the European Parliament coincide across a range of issues, even though there are still issues that we must discuss further together. Mr Bushill-Matthews, who is standing in as rapporteur for Mr Bowis, mentioned in his introduction that this was a difficult and sensitive issue. ||| As Mr Maaten said, there is a need here to achieve a compromise not only in the European Parliament but also in the Council of course. I am delighted that the JURI Committee has welcomed the proposal to increase legal certainty.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'accordingly'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance, or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included, for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions. The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive, is something which I would urge you to support. ||| By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay. I would urge you to endorse this.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and- even more importantly- we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards. Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement. ||| I should like to address one final point. We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'considering this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I should like to make just a few comments. Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner- and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground- to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, be it on the roads, on the waterways or at sea. ||| Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998, even though Parliament responded relatively quickly, this time lag is a little too long. This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| Delays in the CEN's work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive. In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments. ||| I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job. In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', None] ||| Equally, unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all, indeed they rose in some cases. I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently. ||| Even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries. Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment, then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development, improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training.  Genuine structural reforms and a competition-friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly. Hence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future. ||| The European Commission's decisions, which feature in the report, are welcomed by the European Parliament, as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases, thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty. The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission's most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau, Mr Langen, Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer, as well as the Commission, for their excellent cooperation. Competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story; take the energy and telecommunications sectors, where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service. ||| All this is to the good of the consumer. But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further.  The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points: dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I will give you an example: the European Union was right to support the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg, although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained. But these are competitive jobs, for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany. ||| Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle, by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time, would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region's employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are, of course, dependent on too. It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union's competition policy is designed to achieve.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system. I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law. ||| We would be changing the law to make it executable again, which is something I consider to be unacceptable. The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Now it is, of course, possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the Member States and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity. There is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level. ||| When it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda, it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis. We also face difficulties with regard to offences. ||| Nothing has changed there. As has always been the case, there are offences that transcend European offences, as it were, or at least there is the potential for them to do so, and these might include money-laundering, receiving stolen goods, and forming a criminal organisation.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The 15 clearly do not suffice. These guarantee- making no claim to be exhaustive- a minimum of 3 things. No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. ||| All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances. This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'bearing this in mind'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| However, we must stick to the facts. The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years. ||| The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken. I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We are now endeavouring, at huge cost, to get the country back on its feet again and help its people, and rightly so. Secondly, at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU. ||| The Commission in Brussels responded to the victims' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders. "We do not have the wherewithal for that," they said.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| There have always been natural disasters and there always will be. Of course, there is a need for solidarity here. ||| There is certainly a need for European civil protection, and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters. But, most importantly, it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned- despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries- and never nature, for nature cannot make mistakes.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| What is your schedule, how long will it take you to produce a positive list? When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof? ||| The final part of my question is as follows: when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States? That is another point, i.e. the question of obligation, which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'more specifically'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', None] ||| Nevertheless, the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see, and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report.  Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments, it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points. Allow me to start with the most important demand. ||| We do not want financial control to be abolished. The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made, not in every case, but wherever uncertainties or risks arise.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'by comparison'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Up until now, the Commission's payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa. And so it is the "two key" principle that applies here. ||| A single key is to suffice in future. The financial controller is no longer to make advance checks, if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the Commission.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'considering the fact that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The Austrian People's Party, which I represent here in this Parliament, used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the European Union, and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement.  We respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our Member States as to the way ahead for Austria. Our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present. ||| Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship, many people were perpetrators too, although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt. The ÖVP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself? ||| Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here? Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days?
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'bearing this in mind'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I have three short questions, the first being as follows. We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice. ||| Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry, Foreign Trade, Competition and the Internal Market? I am sure that your answer to this will be "yes" but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be?
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I propose to confine my comments to two areas. Firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve, that is achieve in the real sense. ||| There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account. My comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Therefore, whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions, I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible. My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission. Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations? ||| How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view, as this will have important implications, notably for the accession negotiations and for our country, which shares common borders with so many applicant countries? 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'considering the fact that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-à-vis UNMIK. In other words, there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either. ||| Of all people, it is the Albanians, who are now being integrated into the transitional council, who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'differentcon'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions. I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future. ||| It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this. However, we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I would like to highlight the issue of human rights. The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today? ||| We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen: people are killed, people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'accordingly'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I would like to thank the rapporteur, who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task, in conjunction with the Commissioner of course. We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content, of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect. ||| One seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind, where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision. What kind of horse-trading system is this? Certainly not a fair one!
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'even though'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Youth, education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values, for giving the citizens confidence in the European Union and making it credible in their eyes. The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union's goals. ||| Cultural activity creates identity. Cultural activity is an expression of individuality, of an individual's own personality; it builds relationships and communicates.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support. Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered. ||| The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro! 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', None] ||| All the same, there is one point on which we are in conflict. In the grand scheme of the directive, it is perhaps a minor point, but nevertheless a disputed one. ||| It concerns the issue of recycling costs. Here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year's debate in the Council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were lumped together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'nothing no relation'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation. In setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more. ||| This is totally unacceptable. I therefore appeal to the German delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today!
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  I consider the casting of Jörg Haider as "Europe's scapegoat" (or even worse, neo-Nazi and Super Racist) to be counterproductive. ||| Of course I, in no way, agree with the publicised statements of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the Hitler regime. However, I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multiply Haider's adherents.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| There is no direct transition between INTERREG II and III, the practical consequences of which are uncertainty in terms of planning and gaps in funding. That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects. ||| When INTERREG is implemented, it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effects. In this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under LEADER is very welcome. ||| Agriculture is one of the cornerstones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the LEADER initiative. In the same way, through the LEADER initiative, structural change in agriculture can be supported by creating new jobs in rural areas. Attention must be paid in the LEADER+ programme to all the sectors of the economy in rural areas; only a combined effort will reap an optimal result.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'the reasons isare that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angles: preservation of jobs, stewardship of the countryside and, not least, local culture, because that is of the utmost importance. ||| Only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured. We can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the Alps and they are devastating.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'considering this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Of course this is also the basic idea. It is to take new ideas and try them out in LEADER, with the participants on the ground, with the local organisations on the ground, with many non-governmental organisations, with the churches, with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities. ||| Here we must ensure that the good schemes, those which are really excellent, are then somehow transferred into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Chancellor Schüssel's government will maintain the refugee policy of the former social democratic government led by Chancellor Klima. There is no change in refugee policy in Austria! ||| Rural areas make up over 80% of the EU's territory and 25% of the population live in them. As a farmer and Member of Parliament, I have always endeavoured not to look at agriculture in isolation but to see rural areas as a whole.  I attach particular importance to adopting an integrated approach towards rural development because I am convinced that only cooperation linking up all people from all walks of life in rural areas will permit them to be active and attractive places to live for everyone; I refer, in short, to the multifunctionality of rural areas.  I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER+ programme because of its comprehensive nature.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| How are priorities supposed to be set here? There is agreement on the principle that marginalisation, discrimination and inequalities on the labour market should be reduced. ||| Transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs. I have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the TAOs.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully. I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union. ||| We in the European Union are one Community. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions.  Nonetheless, I agree with you, Mr President of the Commission, that many more steps to strengthen the European Union will be needed in the future because the European Union is not strong enough either to master the huge, inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which, to put it mildly, have an ambivalent attitude towards European values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent. That does not apply to Austria alone. ||| The Union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institutions of the EU confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in Austria. However, the full potential of these values will only be realised if they are set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the Treaty and, in the final analysis, represent legal claims on the part of individual citizens.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| First, streamlining. What you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the Commission is only the beginning. ||| The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to core areas of policy. In other words, a social, ecologically-orientated market, a secure currency, guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'by comparison'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  The Commission is planning in particular to develop a genuine European policy on asylum and immigration. It wishes to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all forms of crime" . ||| That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security, freedom, citizens' rights and judicial cooperation. A paper this short is a farce.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Culture and training simply do not exist in this paper, despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe. Just a few main points. ||| I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture; they create jobs. I am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy areas, about consolidating and improving the European dimension of training and education syllabuses and about networking training and education policies in Europe especially lifelong learning.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| No, it does not! In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever. ||| You say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'to sum up'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We need to break away from planned economy subsidies in favour of a liberal policy which fosters personal responsibility. We must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry. ||| What it comes down to is the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the existence of thousands of jobs in the processing industry and offshore fishing. However, I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor, which affects not only Germany but all the coastal regions of Europe.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  In other words, we shall be discussing other proposals here in Parliament over the next few months. ||| That this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin, antibiotic, sludge and other scandals have attracted. In other words, this is an important facet of public health protection, which is why we believe that Article 152 should be taken as the legal base, not Article 37, as proposed by the Commission.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them. Up the point at which meat, milk, bread and other products are sold over the shop counter, feedingstuffs and additives are structured, mixed, blended, cut and transported several times. ||| The fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems, just as it does in the foodstuffs industry. The negative consequences are well known, the positive ones less so.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| My question, Commissioner Byrne is this: the UN conference in Montreal decided that genetically-modified organisms must be labelled for international trade. Do you really believe that, if we could, Parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the European Union? ||| Commissioner Byrne, it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with Parliament. We negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'considering this'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| I should, however, like to add that no new scientific knowledge was needed which proved that the experimental infection of sheep by feeding them BSE-infected feed produced a clinical expression of the disease which is indistinguishable from the symptoms of scrapie. No new knowledge was needed, because the theory from the beginning was that BSE and scrapie must be related and this theory has increasingly taken hold. ||| From this point of view we are slightly behind the times. I am therefore in complete agreement with the Commission's proposal on scrapie.  I should, however, like to add that it only makes sense if we ensure that the new TSE regulation allows a reasonable symbiosis between consumer protection and practicable suggestions.  We therefore need to take consistent account of six or seven points in the coming debate on the TSE proposal, and that of course includes scrapie.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The problem is one of both water quality and water resources, of which there is not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe, especially in very dry regions.  I am sorry that Commissioner Wallström, who is responsible in this area, cannot be here now because this is, after all, a very, very important directive on which the Commission has been working for a long time, and water protection legislation, which we are debating now at second reading, affects all the citizens of the European Union as well as all the people in countries wishing to join, who will have to comply with EU legislation once they accede.  We have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994. A great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous Members of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers. ||| We reduced the 243 proposed amendments in the Environment Committee to 77, but another 30 have been added. You see, there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different. Some want tighter legislation, some want more clarification, others want to serve national interests.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'considering this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  We can achieve this long-term objective by developing measures with demanding standards. ||| In this respect, I fully support the amendments proposed by Mrs Lienemann to develop a reasonable approach using quality standards so that we can eventually say that, when people use water, they are not consuming it but maintaining present stocks. This directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| And considering how long this Chamber has been trying to introduce a framework directive of this kind, I am pleased to be present here today, and I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on being in the happy position of presenting this report to us. However, it is also extremely important to me to point something out that many people actually take for granted. ||| I would still like to highlight this point though: this directive does not constitute any kind of legal basis for diverting water from a Member State's territory against its will. And by way of reaffirming this once again, I have introduced an amendment- gratifyingly with the support of a large number of Members- and I would be very pleased if Parliament would endorse my proposed amendment tomorrow.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for instance'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| For instance, the very rapidly growing educational and technological potential of the Internet offers entirely new means of helping the developing countries, which at present still have modest resources, to move towards a global approach, as opposed to globalisation. I see it as a future task of the EU to contribute in this way to the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises in the ACP states, which can promote self-help. ||| An example here is the problem in Nigeria, which imports industrial finished products from all over the world and then has to spend substantial resources on product maintenance by foreign workers. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'nothing no relation'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Most appropriately, given that this year we are celebrating 25 years of cooperation under Lomé, we will shortly be signing a new and more advanced partnership agreement, which also upgrades the Joint Assembly into a genuine parliamentary assembly on both sides. So I do not want to look back only to the year 1999. The rapporteur, Mr Corrie, has already done so most expertly. ||| Much of what concerns us today is the outcome of fundamental processes of transformation in all parts of the world since the late 1980s. They also had strong repercussions in the developing countries.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| So if the European Union, the Council and the Commission are proposing- and I assume that Parliament will support that proposal tomorrow- the first stabilisation and association agreement in south-eastern Europe, in the Balkan region- I am quite happy to use that term- it is primarily in gratitude for or acknowledgement of the fact that FYROM itself has worked its way into a good position, in economic and, of course, mainly in political terms, in face of the war in the neighbouring region and also in relation to its own minority.  For it is no small thing to have a minority of 33% or even 35% in one's own country. That country and its politicians- no doubt with some differences here and there- have always done very good work, and we should recognise that. ||| The Commission is proposing that we should conclude an agreement jointly with the Council. Let me make a few comments on aspects on which views may differ somewhat, although, even in this regard, I want to strongly emphasise and acknowledge Commissioner Patten's activities and interest in relation to FYROM and the region as a whole.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite the fact that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| So I welcome Mr Swoboda's excellent report, especially paragraph 12, which quite clearly maps out a European, an EU, prospect for Macedonia. Without indulging in any illusions, I believe that is important, it has to happen. ||| We know it cannot happen overnight, but a definite statement to the effect that Macedonia is quite clearly a European country and therefore has the right to be a member of the European Union is a most important, confidence-building measure. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'incidentally'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| It is a highly complex problem. If we do not act promptly- as Mrs Cederschiöld rightly said- anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation. ||| Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We need to define the precise responsibilities of the ECB, the national central banks, the Commission and Europol pertaining to all matters relating to counterfeiting of the euro. I also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or EU body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work. ||| In the same context, we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock, together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities. Aside from the report, which we welcome, many questions have arisen that still need to be resolved.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'differentcon'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| So it is clearly necessary to ask what the EU is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiting. And that is what we are discussing at this late hour. ||| This really is a subject that is close to the citizen, so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| No longer must it be acceptable for the ECOFIN ministers to allow each other to celebrate consolidation successes at home while responsibility for the massive unemployment in Europe remains shrouded in mystery. I wish you much strength, pledge Parliament's support and assure you that this Parliament will have more to say on the issues of economic and employment policy in the future, as the people of Europe also expect. ||| That would give you another ally for your policy. 
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The content of the regulation must therefore be supported in full, although the budget proposed by the Council is not sufficient by far. That is why I should like to ask all colleagues to vote in favour, in particular, of Amendment No 11, so that at least reasonable financial provision is made, even if this falls well below the amount for previous initiatives and is still only around EUR 13 million a year. ||| Even at this early stage a considerable increase needs to be considered for when the Treaty or the regulation is revised. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| This is what this is about, and a majority of us have said as much in debates here. In January we had a very thorough debate with you, Commissioner, on the consequences of the Erika disaster. ||| On this occasion we once again drew together all the points on ship safety and clean seas. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Can that be deducted from the time? Commissioner, I actually wanted to address a minor comment to you, which applies both to this report and to the preceding one. ||| There comes a time when you have to come to a decision, because post-Amsterdam the conciliation procedure is the great good. Parliament is obviously always pleased when the Commission fights at Parliament's side as its partner and does not necessarily rush obediently to the Council's cause.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I do not see the work programme make any mention whatsoever of tourism. We are talking about one of the most important branches of industry here, both within the EU and beyond its borders. ||| We have long been promised measures for this sector. It requires improvement as a matter of urgency, but nothing is happening.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Duff and Voggenhuber, on the other hand, think of themselves as true European Parliamentarians whose task it is to further the interests of Europe as a whole. And so tomorrow, we will be able to adopt a report, which is based on the premise that naturally the European Parliament, and not the national governments, would be responsible for instituting the fundamental rights of the European Union. ||| This Charter will only meet the needs of the citizens of Europe under two provisos. Firstly, it must be given substance, and secondly, it must be made binding in law. However, it is stunningly disappointing to note how the Convention, which has been specifically set up for this purpose, is high on competences but very low in courage.  And so really, this report could also be viewed as an appeal to the Convention that goes like this: 'Dare to do something at long last!
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for instance'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The fact that fundamental rights have come to be guaranteed under constitutional law over the past 200 years is largely down to the impact these universal documents of fundamental rights have had. It is now the task of twenty-first century Europe to combine the existing fundamental rights in the Member States and those aspects that apply to Europe. ||| The fundamental rights such as freedom of worship, freedom to meet and form associations, for example, are sacrosanct and inalienable rights to freedom from state intervention. Applied to Europe this means that a European Charter of Fundamental Rights must protect the citizens of the European Union against the interference and intervention of European institutions in the fundamental rights of the citizens.  Furthermore, our group hopes that a written European catalogue of fundamental rights will put European integration on a firmer legal-ethical footing and help to create greater transparency and clarity for the citizens.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'specifically'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| That is why we must overcome this problem. But I do not believe that we can solve the problem by paying fees for fishing quotas under a new agreement with Greenland. ||| That is no way to solve the problem. We must draw a distinction.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The European eco-label is, it has to be said, a product of the internal market. Its function, partly in response to the increasing flow of products across borders, is to label products and services which have a high level of environmental compatibility. ||| Its function, on the one hand, is to provide information to consumers from one country to the next and, on the other, to increase awareness within industry and among citizens to recognise and promote environmental issues. And this is of major importance when it comes to the daily shopping trip.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'the reasons isare that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I think this can be seen from some of the amendments which were put forward in committee with regard to coincineration and which now reappear as amendments in plenary. We cannot in any way guarantee that in restricting coincineration we will actually achieve what we want environmentally. ||| Above all we want to save fossil fuels. If we set up the hurdles wrong here, then we will not achieve the right environmental objective.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'considering this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We in this House have always agreed that we must reduce the proportion of fossil fuels and that we must save energy. If we do not achieve this, then this is a declaration of environmental bankruptcy. ||| If the perceptions of the European Commission as regards this basic assumption become reality, then there is no need for us to talk any further in this House about climate protection. 
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', None] ||| I would not want to change or spare anything in achieving this. I also find it encouraging that the Commission is consequently taking care that EU legislation is being implemented. ||| All the same, in the case of the FFH directive the question arises as to whether the legislation which we have adopted is actually implementable and I can see obvious weak points. As I see it, the FFH directive is an instance where the legislation is not matched to the feasibilities of the regions.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  At the moment, I am more interested in protected areas for delegates, but that is another matter. ||| Our question to you, Commissioner, has another purpose. I would have liked to hear your answer first, but you have chosen to speak at the end of the debate.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| They include the right to personal and political freedom and basic social and economic rights. The idea of human rights is one of the most exalted ideas which mankind has ever had and has its roots in the concentration camps and gulags of the last century. ||| It appeals to everything which makes man a human being and which makes him aware of his dignity, uniqueness, freedom and equality with other men. The way in which human rights have spread illustrates the fact that this human image has huge powers to project and concern for human dignity is at the core of any human rights policy.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in particular'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Christianity contributes to the catalogue of values of the European Union, but there are also other currents which have found their way into the catalogue of values of the European Union and I think it is important that we establish this once and for all. As far as the debate on the Ludford and Haarder reports is concerned, allow me to make a few technical observations on behalf of my Group. ||| Mr Haarder submitted an excellent draft report to the committee and the committee tabled 170 proposed amendments and 22 compromise amendments, making a total of 192 amendments. The committee spent days discussing them and then voted on a largely amended report and now we have another 69 proposed amendments here in plenary.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| As far as these candidates are concerned, and this has already been said, we must avoid creating the impression that we demand higher standards of them than we meet ourselves. We should compare the actual situation in these countries with the reality in our own countries rather than with our perfect legal texts, otherwise the candidate countries will always come off worse in practice. ||| Certainly nobody contests the fact that candidate countries which, for example, only acquired their independence recently, such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, have the right to redefine and articulate their own national identity first. As the Communist dictatorship under which they previously suffered obviously did not foster a culture of pluralist debate, many forms of expression of national identity appear to us to be overstretched or even to be directed, indirectly, against minorities within the country or in one or more neighbouring countries.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] |||  Racism, xenophobia and antisemitism are a depressing problem, including within the European Union. ||| Fighting them is one of the common goals of almost every political group in this House. This House is prepared to exercise diplomatic restraint in many areas, but not on this question.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I stand firmly against the way in which racism has been played down, as we have said, to make it a subject of political debate. That is our grave criticism of the approach taken in this report. ||| We are all against racism and we all have a contribution to make. There should be a broad consensus on this in this House.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| You cannot advocate reducing the voting age to sixteen and still say that an eighteen-year-old should not be fingerprinted. It is incomprehensible. ||| It comes down to how this system is seen under the rule of law. If you guarantee that the Council has no objection to leaving implementing powers definitively with the Commission and allowing us in Parliament to exercise a control function, at least in the area of Commission jurisdiction, then that is considerable progress.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Mr President, we are beginning to establish a common asylum and immigration law in Europe. That means that we need instruments to exercise the necessary controls. ||| A common immigration law means that we have no more internal borders and take responsibility for the people entering the European Union at the external borders. It is perfectly clear that there is abuse, for example in connection with asylum claims.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Will the national Prime Ministers of the countries of Europe pass judgement in future? Will a majority of eight votes suffice or will a different majority be needed? ||| In what way do the European Council and the European institutions lose power and the potential to formulate policy as a result? Is this a question of new competition between the European institutions and the national states?
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| This is a trade agreement which falls within the competence of the EU and, as you rightly say, we only have the option of saying yes or no. We cannot renegotiate the agreement. ||| All in all, our Group will vote in favour of this trade agreement, which we welcome. For the rest, I should like to say to Mr Folias, who worries about the problem of footwear that, generally-speaking, trade relations between Europe and Mexico have always proven their worth in the past.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'specifically'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| They believe that, in the EU, they have found a partner which stands for democracy, human rights and social and ecological development. Today we have analysed the contract and found that the agreement with the EU not only creates the same sort of relationship as with NAFTA, but that, in parts, it is even worse. ||| Like the rightly failed MAI, freedom of investment, reproduced bilaterally, does nothing to foster a democratically-controlled economy geared to local development. Placing no limit on opening public procurement merely allows large suppliers to swallow up small suppliers all over the world.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'specifically'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We all agree that new technologies will lead to extensive change, not only in our business life but in all aspects of our social life.  It is also true that the evolution from industrial society to information society cannot be halted and that it therefore makes political sense to prepare Europe for the information society as best we can. I therefore expressly welcome the statement in the e-Europe initiative that its prime objective is to accelerate the positive transformation to the information society in the European Union and gear the transformation towards social and regional integration. ||| The European Commission sets out ten measures in its communication on the e-Europe initiative, which should level the playing field in the run up to the information society in Europe. As welcome as the individual measures are, they need to be structured as a whole and clear priorities need to be set for our policy.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for example'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Improvements are therefore needed here. Secondly: how will our working life and employment relations change? ||| Will people be able to influence how they are organised? We need to consider if we need new joint-decision structures in the face of these revolutionary developments, new structures for listening to employees and making decisions.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'despite this'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', None] ||| For example, the liberalisation of investments which is championed covers all sectors of the economy.  In other words it is a mini-MAI. The drop in the standard of living and the inequalities between the European Union and Mexico which already exist will be exacerbated yet further. ||| Whereas Mexico has been required to make numerous concessions to Europe (such as in the agricultural, investment and public procurement sectors), the EU has included derogations and restrictions for itself in order to keep competition at bay. It is obvious that the European side, especially Europe's large corporate groups, will profit from the agreement with Mexico.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| There is no other explanation as to why the Commission gave way yesterday and suddenly decided to reinterpret the Structural Funds regulation. Having given itself real teeth last year and called in notifications of FFH areas for the joint "Natura 2000" project which had been overdue for years, the Commission has now tripped itself up by accepting that notifications can be submitted ex-post. ||| That was unnecessary in that the regulation fully covered the Commission's demand for FFH lists to be submitted together with the plans at the latest and per se leaves the Commission no room for manoeuvre here. The Structural Funds Regulation- decided unanimously last year by all the Member States- clearly states that the ex-ante evaluation is a prerequisite to the programme and the planning documents which the Member States submit to the Commission for approval.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Over a year ago, in February 1999, there was hope for new relations between India and Pakistan.  In the Lahore declaration, both presidents confirmed their determination to comply with the 1972 Simla agreement. Unfortunately, the Lahore process came to a standstill during the clash over Kargil between May and July 1999. ||| The latest development in Kashmir is worrying. We condemn the continuing human rights violations, the religious fanaticism, the sabotage and the terrorism.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| This task is carried out in parallel by the ECB and the national central banks, whereby the national central banks transfer part of their reserves up to the equivalent of 50 billion euros to the European Central Bank, in accordance with Article 30.1 of the Statute. It was decided at the time, in Article 30.4- which is why today's discussion comes as no surprise- that the ECB could call up further foreign reserve assets beyond the limit set in Article 30.1. ||| This call must be issued in the form of a regulation by the EU Council. The ECB is currently calling for a further increase of 50 billion euros.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| No other course would be possible, because there is no legislative process which is fast enough to allow further changes to be made in May. What is crucial in our view is that noise protection regulations are right for our people, that we must protect people in the vicinity of airports and that American interests have not, in any case, been affected thus far. ||| Individual interests of American companies may be affected, but the regulation does not enter into force for aircraft registered in third countries until 2002, which is why we must bite our tongue somewhat and choose our words carefully, Mr President-in-Office. I wonder if we should abolish this regulation as far as third country aircraft are concerned.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| When I see that we alone in the European Parliament are planning an increase of 0.07% in comparison with the year 2000, then this rigour is guaranteed and we can show our face. Compared with a total budget of EUR 965 million, that does not represent too big a bite out of the cake at our disposal. ||| What are the challenges of Activity Based Budgeting? Of course this is a question which we must also apply to the other institutions, as and where it is sensible to do so.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| There are the hopes of the young, there are hopes throughout the world, in which we, as the rich continent of Europe, and we are the rich continent of Europe, can give assistance. And there are hopes at the heart of Europe, where we have a cancerous growth called war, where there are people who are forced to live in appalling conditions, people who need a future, people who need hope. ||| We do not want any curious divisions of tasks, as are presently becoming apparent, when this money is distributed over the coming weeks and months. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Well, the Structural Funds have helped to apply a brake to this process. Our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator. ||| Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds. What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax, which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level.  The Commission, however, though bound to issue guidelines, does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner.  The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'bearing this in mind'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| I should also like to make a few comments, firstly, Mr Berend, regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report. You pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote, if I am not mistaken, that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports. ||| On behalf of all the officials of the Commission and my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this House and by yourself. The Commission was certainly very anxious to ensure, Mr Berend, that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'differentcon'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I shall point out that a directive on the approximation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 January 1997. This included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999. ||| This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations. In line with the usual procedure, it is the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) which puts forward standards in this area, and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 (known generally as ADR), applicable throughout Europe, whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU.  The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted.  Consequently, the Commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problems, rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements, as should have been the case!
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'this is why'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| We see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in Europe proposed by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power. Eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union, despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world: these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote. ||| The Commission's declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market is ridiculous, for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weakest elements. This is repulsive most of all in social terms.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', None] ||| Admittedly, an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union.  However, as the rapporteur pointed out, such aid is occasionally essential and may, in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm, make it possible to contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty), services of general economic interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158). Clearly though, it must be monitored, a task which falls to the European Commission. ||| The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997, including 40% allocated to the manufacturing sector. This aid is considerably less than the previous period, 1993-1995 (a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector).
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'this is why'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| The crux of the problem is that all governments, and indeed all the European institutions, acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Total-Fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment. They accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks, even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions. ||| In these circumstances, even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations' capacity to cause damage. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'bearing this in mind'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I would like to congratulate the regional authorities, the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but, unfortunately, their troubles are not yet over. It is Europe's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster. ||| I welcome Mr Barnier's statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced. I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter, as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this.  The Community action programme for civil protection, established by a Council decision on 9 December, was launched on 1 January 2000.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We really hope and believe so. Never have the parties been so determined. ||| One fundamental point to be stressed is the balance which must be expressed in the message from Europe and which must exist between the people. There must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations. Following the attack in Hadera on Monday, we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'even though'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this. ||| We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom, security and justice, particularly social justice. Yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for instance'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete. ||| The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this. The decision to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be welcomed but it is difficult to predict whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic, including all people, whatever their nationality, or excluding some.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We could mention, my Belgian friends, Belgium and the Dutroux case, the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country, where inquiries are bogged down, making no headway. We could, if one third of the Members of Parliament so requested, require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter. ||| We could ask ourselves why the Austrians are rejecting 10 years, 13 years of party politics which has made one country- Austria- corrupt and rotten, just as it is now corrupting countries such as Italy, Belgium and other European Union Member States. We might well wonder why 76% of Belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56% of French citizens have no confidence in their country's system of justice, and 53% of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in Italian justice...
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'considering this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| They put their own petty squabbles first, and the rest is history. We must make a rapid, strong and united response. ||| I would have liked to hear your discussion with the Austrian President, Mr Poettering. We are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'for example'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| This Chamber, and the European institutions, were build to uphold values, morality and a certain spirit. In the twentieth century, we have had experience of the fact that democracies can find themselves at risk, and morality, values and the spirit which I mentioned can be mortally affected by viruses which have just one name: nationalist glorification, populism and the concept of racial superiority. ||| The fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of Mr Haider's party, the FPÖ, to find nationalist glorification, populism and racial superiority in every chapter. Reading only one sentence which my friend, Mr Vidal-Quadras, has previously mentioned, "The nation is defined by its location, culture and race, locally, ethnically and culturally."
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  After having restricted, on its own initiative, its participation in the IGC to two minor seats, Parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC. ||| The fact is, whether through weakness or foolishness- nothing to be proud of either way, you will admit- in rushing to give its opinion, Parliament is giving up the only lever which the Treaty accords it, i.e. demanding a complete IGC agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion. Why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow, 3 February, as a matter of urgency, when we could wait, in a position of strength, until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on 14 February, and thus force an agenda that is complete, and therefore consistent, on the Council.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', None] ||| Indeed, it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate, which the Commission framed for its own opinion, but using all the terms thereof, plus everything between the lines. We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers, which is, in any case, an incorrect label. ||| I do not like the term 'leftovers' any more than Richard Corbett does. 
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite the fact that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We agree that it may be granted and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring, once the decision has been taken, that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible. We are talking about macrofinancial aid. ||| There are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration. This is not our opinion.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| It is with great satisfaction that I today welcome this 'happy ending' in this House, and I thank you for it. I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process. ||| I should like to express especial thanks to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, particularly to its rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, its chairman, Mr Gargani, the European Parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups, the Conciliation Committee and its chairman, Mr Imbeni. They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'to provide background information'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year. In some of our Member States, voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed to ensure that our ditches, canals and fields are not filled with these ugly and dangerous wrecks, inhabited occasionally by an alarmed farmyard chicken. ||| I come, of course, from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in Europe and in third countries. I can gauge its importance for my country's international reputation.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I urge the Commission to be less cautious. In this resolution, Parliament is assuming its responsibilities. ||| Having said that, in my opinion, the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum, the very least we could do. Personally I argued in favour of a rather harder line, and I supported Amendments Nos 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8, as well as the oral amendment tabled by the Socialist Group.  In fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an Austrian Government which includes members of the Austrian Freedom Party.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', None] ||| The confidence of millions of Europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this.  And how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption?  You are responsible for millions of unemployed and for millions living in poverty, insecurity and increasing misery because of your ultra-trade-oriented and ultra-liberal policies and because of the forced march towards the single currency. You wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders. Consequently, you have opened Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration. ||| You are now proposing to give all decision-making power to a handful of officials. The Member States, local authorities and NGOs will simply become enforcers of decisions handed down from above, all on an equal footing in their submission to Brussels. Not once does your twelve-page document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'bearing in mind that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| What is meant by the Commission's declared objective of 'economic reform' in the labour market? Does this mean more flexibility, insecurity and fixed-term contracts? ||| Everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth. The Union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  The serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme. ||| From your speech I will concentrate on what you have called the new governance, which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizens. Yet this new governance simply means how the institutions and our public authorities operate, if we agree that the European Union must be a public authority.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for instance'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The supposed progress achieved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occurred in the Dublin Conventions and Schengen Agreements and a further action plan from Tampere which all restrict the rights of immigrants. In terms of human rights, this is a backward step. ||| Europe is continuing to expel nationals arriving from countries regarded as dangerous by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Yet some applicant countries in central and eastern Europe are taking in gypsy refugees expelled en masse from Belgium. Kosovo Albanians and Serb deserters are being refused refugee status, whereas Pinochet is calmly escaping prosecution.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| For example, to accept new roads is to accept new pollution within the European Union. This goes totally against the policies which we are proposing to fight greenhouse gas emissions, for example. I would also ask the Commission to ensure that the environmental pillar of the EU's policy is integrated into the projects submitted and that the goal of reducing CO2 for example forms an experimental added value in the projects proposed. ||| I am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| This is why the INTERREG Community Initiative was launched in 1990. This programme was designed to encourage cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union. ||| INTERREG serves principally to fund Community schemes to develop SMEs, education and training, cultural exchanges, action to combat health problems, the protection and improvement of the environment, energy, transport and telecommunications networks. I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I and my colleague Dominique Souchet, who is well versed in this matter, have tabled five amendments highlighting the role of SMEs and craft trades within the framework of INTERREG, the importance of cooperation between undertakings and the need to involve economic and social partners in the design and implementation of the programmes and I welcome the fact that these amendments were adopted unanimously. Nonetheless, the French delegation in our group was unable to accept the fact that the Commission and the federalist faction have diverted the INTERREG initiative from its original purpose in order to detract still further from the political role of the nations. ||| We have no intention of giving Brussels the job of regulating regional planning in the Member States, as suggested in recital of the report. We only ask one thing of the Commission: that it confine itself to ensuring that the implementation of joint policies does not upset the balance of regional planning in our territories.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'in short'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| This proposal has no financial consequences for the Community budget. There must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety. ||| I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which, as you know, was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'considering this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  Climate change, global resources, river quality and groundwater aquifer quality are major challenges which threaten our common future. ||| We will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet's ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse events which will threaten the development of certain regions, the living conditions of the inhabitants of other regions and even, more fundamentally, the global balance. To support this statement, I would point to an excellent report drafted by our colleague, Mário Soares, in the international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', None] ||| We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water, given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land. Agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive. ||| It is not only in the Member States that solutions to these problems are being sought. Last October in Turin, the countries in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership bluntly demanded a Marshall plan for water for the south coast of the Mediterranean. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'specifically'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  In this context, the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated. ||| The essential criterion is the rights of citizens with regard to the European institutions, as contained in the European project enshrined in the Treaties of the European Union. I understand your concern about the rights of children.  Many elements of our work, and particularly of my work as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, involve protecting the rights of children.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'specifically'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Turning now to the question posed by Mr Alavanos, who I hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject, the Commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor, during the preparation of the new programming period, the application of the partnership principle. The involvement of regional and local authorities in the Community's action is, as you know, one of the essential elements of the new post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation. ||| With regard to the specific application of this partnership principle within the next Community support framework for Greece, the Commission has noted that the public authorities were largely involved during the preparation of the Greek regional development plan for the 2000-2006 period. Mr Alavanos knows that I have been to Greece twice under the quite tragic circumstances of the earthquake disaster. During these visits, I held discussions with the Greek Government and raised this concern about the correct implementation of the partnership objective and requirement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'for example'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| On your second point of renewable energy which, as you know, is of great interest to me, the Commission's approach is given in the document on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Funds. These Funds specify that investments in the renewable energy sector must be encouraged where they favour the development of local resources, where they contribute to reducing dependency on energy imports and where they create jobs at local level. ||| I was able to verify this, for example, during a visit I made to the Azores in Portugal a few days ago with regard to a natural source of renewable energy. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'bearing this in mind'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  As in the past, these rules state that the additionality principle applies to the relationship between the Structural Funds and all development expenditure of the Member State. ||| In this respect, it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the Structural Funds which must be additional. The cofinancing provided by the Member State does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'considering this'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] |||  I have given you my answer. ||| I am keen that the Structural Funds, particularly those in Objective 1, are allocated where needed. We have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'to provide background information'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| That explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions, ambitions for which, of course, there is a price. Obviously, the basic item for discussion with the Council will be the allocation for LIFE III. ||| The common position stipulates a total appropriation of EUR 613 million for the period 2000-2004. This is not enough. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of increasing this amount to EUR 850 million.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We state that good governance and an end to corruption are mandatory but we continue to pour hundreds of thousands of euros into Swiss bank accounts via the portfolios of a number of Heads of State. The third area of incoherence is human rights. ||| We say that we want to protect human rights. We encourage developing countries to respect human rights.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'considering this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| With Europe preparing to enlarge, communitising the EDF would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the Community budget, quite apart from the fact that we would be wasting a fruitful and promising opportunity of associating our southern partners with our cooperation policy. Lastly, the Commission has, in the recent past, had trouble managing the funds for development and humanitarian aid transparently, as Mrs Maes has just reminded us so opportunely. ||| Why should we add to them? Secondly, we find it most regrettable that Mr Corrie's report should mention the trade and development agreement with South Africa because, in the final analysis, this report is typical of the amateur diplomacy to which the European Commission is taking ever more frequent recourse.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'considering this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| However the Union should be seeking, beyond that, to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater. Public health and the supply of drinking water are at stake, as are biological quality and diversity and the conservation of rural areas and species. ||| From this point of view, the common position is weak. I should like to see our Parliament defend a more ambitious position than the Council's position, but I should also like that position to be equally credible.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'in short'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| As Mr Patten said, and I would like to thank him for the positions which he defended, the crucial point is China.  Unfortunately, the positions taken by the Commission and the Council, or at least the presidency, are more than just a hair's breadth apart; this is serious, especially in the light of the Council's macho position on Austria.  In my view, as far as China is concerned, and knowing that the European Union's policy towards China has been a total failure, allegedly constructive dialogue has got us nowhere or, worse, it has given the Chinese new pretexts for increasing repression and for strengthening religious repression and the repression of freedoms (as Mrs Wallström has said with regard to the Internet) in all sectors, in Tibet, in inland Mongolia, in eastern Turkistan. There is regression in every sector of Chinese civil society. ||| It is a fact: China is the major threat, the major threat to us, the threat which we must confront, the threat to peace. It is the antithesis of democracy and you know as well as I that the Chinese, the Chinese leadership, is Communist first and Chinese second.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'specifically'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  This proposal is similar to the proposal submitted for other candidate countries and, once it is implemented, will replace the financial protocols which have now expired. ||| Pre-accession instruments are designed to provide technical and financial support for efforts by candidate countries to meet the demands of the Community acquis. The Commission's analysis has in fact shown that, although classified as high income countries by the World Bank, Cyprus and Malta have the same difficulties as the CEECs in transposing Community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'the reasons isare that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The Union has finally accepted the idea that dialogue cannot be genuine or effective unless it is the expression of a contract which respects the dignity of the partners. By refusing to allow the idea of good governance to become a tool, in the hands of technocrats, for imposing new sets of conditions, the European Union is demonstrating wisdom and modesty. ||| We have spent two centuries laying the foundations of a democracy whose fragility is constantly brought home to us by events. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for instance'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| But this is not just a masterpiece of hypocrisy, it is also an aberration, because, if negotiations begin tomorrow, this agreement will be signed in a year and will come into force in three years. And I defy you to imagine that there will not be membership applications in due form from Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia, amongst the Balkan countries, three years hence. ||| A few days ago Mr Racan announced that Croatia's formal membership application would be presented at the end of 2000. There are bound to be other applications and this great work, this fine intellectual architecture, will crumble, left behind by events just as we have been left behind by everything that has been happening in the former Yugoslavia for the past 20 years.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The fact is people are suddenly going to lose all their currency references, and that means they will be at serious risk of easily accepting forged euros because they are not very familiar with the genuine article. So the Council is naturally worried and is seeking to establish sanctions, primarily criminal, applicable in all the countries of Europe, against offences of this kind. ||| No doubt the Council could have been satisfied with a simple resolution recommending that Member States adopt national legislation to that effect. That is what I would have preferred, personally.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The second proposal, on which the report is excellent, does not require any particular comment. It aims to strengthen consumer protection and security. ||| It is a step in the right direction, even if one wonders why in heaven, with what right and with what respect for our citizens, we are further bolstering the monopoly of the English language in all documents distributed throughout Europe. That is the thrust of an amendment which we have tabled; it favours all the languages of the Community and our agreement to the second directive will depend on it.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', None] ||| Rezala should never have been in France. He arrived from Algeria at a time when, according to the authorities, immigration had been stopped and there was no reason for him to come. He should never have stayed in France, having been reported to the transport police more than 40 times for offences, which should have been enough for him to be expelled back to his home country. ||| He should never have been free because 14 charges of theft, violence and rape had been brought against him, one of which was for the rape of a minor. He should never have been able to escape from France, but the officers pursuing him had no jurisdiction and European frontiers have more holes than a sieve.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'specifically'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| And this dialogue is open-ended; it adapts to the demands of the day.  Nowadays, certain forms of crime are cross-border crimes and it is, of course, in the interests of the Member States to improve cooperation so that they can crack down on them.  But the Council's draft leaves a lot to be desired and attracts criticism on several counts. First, the form: the draft convention is vague in the extreme, and this is totally incompatible with the objective of legal certainty in a modern society. ||| It is not just a question of style. We are taking about criminal law here and criminal law has to be interpreted by the letter.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'afterwards'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  Back in 1994, the Joint Assembly passed an initial resolution, in which our fellow Member Dominique Souchet was closely involved, expressing its alarm at the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay Round, which contradicted the very principle of Community preference which was fundamental to this cooperation. ||| These fears have been taking shape over the last two years and the banana row is the clearest expression of them. The developing countries are asked to fall into line with the liberalisation of trade, despite their vulnerable economies.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| All the Spanish democrats wounded by what is happening in their country have our full and complete support. It was not only immigrants who were the victims of atrocities; the democratic system in Spain has been held up to ridicule, despite having demonstrated its tremendous capacity to evolve over the last 20 years. ||| Employers would be lost without immigrants. Working conditions are so hard and so deplorable that no Spaniard will accept them.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'accordingly'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| These violent scenes at El Ejido are so similar to archive pictures of Alabama in the 1950s, when the KKK terrified the black population, that it is hard to tell them apart. They also put us in mind of Germany in the 1930s, when the Nazis were persecuting the Jews. Without wishing to lump everything together hysterically, because each period is different, we have failed to learn the lessons of history. ||| That is my conclusion today. Because this witch hunt which broke out in the province of Almería should have been foreseen.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', None] ||| I became convinced of this in Sarajevo when I had to negotiate the periodic exchanges of prisoners which accompanied each successive ceasefire agreement, none of which unfortunately lasted, between the parties to the conflict. Every time, just as the exchange was about to take place, we found men missing from the meticulously drawn up lists. ||| Every time, when we asked why, the reply was the same, 'We cannot release him: he is a war criminal' . In the emotion, pain and fury of the agreements, it was impossible to break the vicious circle of blood and vengeance.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  Once again, there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important wetland in Europe. ||| The delta of the Danube is in danger. As in Spain in April 1998, as in Brittany and the Vendée since last December, once again an exceptional natural site is under serious threat.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  For example, the overflow from the decanting basins at the gold mines in Salsigne, in France, have caused tremendous pollution and are a huge economic disaster even today. ||| We know full well that pollution and restoration costs run into billions. Who is going to pay?
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| This could be developed and provide a large number of new jobs. But these regions need to take real account of positive and negative experiences in other tourist sectors. ||| We must not kill the goose that lays the golden egg of tourism. Tourism must be environmentally friendly if it is to continue to be an asset in the future.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'the reasons isare that'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] |||  I wonder, and here I do not entirely agree with the positive interpretations of a number of press bodies and fellow Members, about the direction in which we are going. ||| I think that contrary to the great process of Economic and Monetary Union, which was an integrated process within the Community structures, today, unfortunately, the common foreign and security policy is entirely an intergovernmental procedure. My first question, Mr Solana and Commissioner, is to establish whether, together, you have framed strategies that will, at least gradually, lead to the creation of a process that integrates the common foreign and security policy within the Community process.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Now, what has happened and what is still happening in Chechnya is similar to genocide. How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants, the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns, villages and districts where, in amongst the whole of the civilian population, there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters? ||| How should we describe the sinister filtration camps, which are comparable to concentration camps, in which the population is suffering the most dreadful humiliation and from which able-bodied men between 15 and 65 years old rarely get out alive? How can we describe the rapes, the looting, the deliberate fires, the deportations, which are called "cleansing" , that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe?
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'the reasons isare that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| When I see that we are asking for training for women in politics, I want to say- no, definitely not. Let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics- but why especially compel women to undergo training? ||| That simply amounts to acknowledging their inferiority. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', None] ||| Let us not forget that fish are at the very basis of our food chain and that the first 'environmental' disaster, Minamata disease, occurred in 1958 in Japan owing to the fact that fish were polluted by mercury. We should therefore very carefully monitor pollution from industrial activity, but also from domestic activity. ||| I do not believe that ejecting emissions at sea, and particularly in a closed environment like the Mediterranean, when we want to clean up purification plants, is a good way to clean up water. We should pay particular attention to telluric pollution, to development, to the urbanisation of coastal areas, etc. But we should also think about restoring the environment and, for example, solving the problems associated with caulerpa taxifolia, and the areas of posidonia that are disappearing and which must therefore be protected.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  Cakes of tar are still washing in along 500 km of the Atlantic coastline on a daily basis. ||| Curiously, the exact composition of the cargo has still not been clarified. The ecological disaster is a major one, possibly unprecedented in scale.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'considering this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The wreck still contains 16 000 tonnes of heavy gas oil which is leaking and, in addition to these leaks, unfortunately, last week we observed and counted 35 acts of ecological piracy, 35 degassing operations, disgracefully aggravating this already catastrophic situation. Mrs de Palacio expressed her views at length regarding this issue and I feel she set to work without waiting for an element which today is absolutely essential, a draft European maritime law, following a draft directive on the maritime transportation of dangerous goods. ||| From this point of view, this fits in with the wish of the French to see their presidency characterised by regulations which work towards increasing safety. The secondary impact, however, is proving to be on the economy, the primary impact being environmental and only the second economic, as many Members have stated.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'rather'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Amendment No 1 serves to clarify the text considerably. Specifically, the data collected must not be intended for purely scientific use. ||| Scientists must process this data and pass it on to the relevant political decision-making authorities. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The disease chiefly affects the Scottish salmon industry. It was detected in this region in May 1998. ||| Today, 240 salmon farms are affected by ISA. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Wages are not equal, women's work is still perceived as 'stop-gap' work and, more generally, female employees do not have access to the same positions of responsibility as men. What is more, women bear the main responsibility for family matters. ||| Women must be entitled to full time employment on an equal footing with men. Mandatory legislation must be adopted in order to encourage equality in the workplace.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Yesterday we discussed the Lisbon Summit for the economic and social revival of Europe. Shared objectives for growth in order to enable us to move towards full employment are something I have hoped and prayed for. ||| Full employment does not mean the total absence of any form of unemployment. There will always be some cyclical unemployment, with workers looking to change jobs, young people entering the labour market.  But full employment will be restored when there are no longer any long-term unemployed and when every young person is offered at least one training course within at least six months of entering the job market.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', None] ||| So why, after so often declaring that the WTO must incorporate social and environmental regulatory mechanisms, and that the European Union intends to guarantee advantages for LDCs, does the Commission still adhere exclusively to the prospect of market liberalisation in this sector? Since Seattle has challenged the inadequacies of existing WTO agreements, I would argue strenuously in favour of the Union handling this issue in accordance with the rules which we intend to see predominate in international trade. ||| I would make the same call for coherence in another area, the management of the pigmeat crisis. You will be aware that, as a result of this crisis, which has now lasted for more than two years, many independent producers find that they have been relegated to being mere casual workers for firms or other large-scale producers.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', None] ||| The addition of any other fats spoils the flavour. Indeed the 1973 directive, which prohibited the use of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter, was intended to safeguard this quality. ||| With the inclusion of new countries in the European Union, some derogations to this strict ban came to be granted. Harmonisation was essential in the name of the free movement of goods.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'bearing this in mind'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Since 1973, European legislation has stipulated that the designation 'chocolate' must be given to products containing only cocoa and cocoa butter. Some Member States have enjoyed a derogation from this law since acceding to the Union. ||| That is fine, let everyone have their own chocolate bar in their own home. In a shop in my own home town, in Reims, I wish to be able to purchase a bar of chocolate produced according to the gastronomic traditions of my own country, without having to inspect the product on all sides and to put my glasses on in order to check its quality.  This labelling frenzy is admittedly necessary since there has been a loss in confidence, but, ladies and gentlemen, if you give up a specific definition of chocolate, then at least do so clearly and openly.  I therefore urge you to support Amendments Nos 29 and 18.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| There will perhaps be a discreet entry, in small letters on the back of the package, indicating its new composition. There will be deterioration in the quality, of course, but also in the flavour, and the goods are clearly not what they are represented as being. ||| This is unfair competition, with this ersatz, pseudo-chocolate being sold cheaper than pure chocolate manufactured by craftsmen with proper respect for authenticity, ethics and tradition. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Indeed there would be a great deal to say about the attitude of some delegations within the Council. Today's consumer has had enough of being deceived. ||| What is the Council putting forward to solve the problem? A tiny piece of difficult-to-read information, hidden on the back of the product wrapper.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'more specifically'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', None] ||| We are talking about harmonisation, the harmonisation of tastes, of habits and, almost, of cultures. In short, chocolate is a dividing factor and the divisions are neither ideological nor even national, whatever some parties might think. ||| What makes defending cocoa-producing countries an ideological matter, I ask you? It is an ethical matter.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for example'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The system generally applied is the one governed by the 'polluter pays' principle, a principle which is outstanding in terms of its inefficiency! This is why we need to find an alternative. ||| Such an alternative is offered to us in an amendment which I supported. The amendment seeks to establish a system of charges which all vessels would have to pay systematically each time they dock in a port, whether or not they make use of the waste disposal facilities.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'more specifically'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I would like to offer a word of thanks to two of my fellow Commissioners, Frits Bolkestein and Anna Diamantopoulou, for the support they have given me in drawing up this text. I should like to remind you that I announced this text on 26 January when the Commission adopted its formal opinion and its proposals for the reform of the institutions. I did mention before this House our intention to outline and clarify some aspects of this opinion at a later date. ||| A few days ago we did this with regard to the Union's system of jurisdiction, the role of the Court of Justice and the role of the Court of First Instance. Today we are doing this with regard to an extremely important, delicate and specific subject, the scope of qualified majority voting in certain areas of taxation and social security.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  This raises problems for us at several phases of the incineration process: the reception, processing and handling of the waste. ||| One might well ask what was the point of combining these two matters. We can find the answer in Mr Blokland's report, which is violently opposed to the coincineration industry.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| This is confirmed yet again by our discussions and the particularly powerful lobbying.  I therefore approve of the European Union's approach which is to adopt an overall strategy in relation to this major environmental and health issue.  Nonetheless, personally speaking, I have always been rather worried to see the incineration of dangerous and non-dangerous waste dealt with in the same legislation, and I expressed my opinion on this point at first reading. The majority decided in favour of coincineration. ||| My opinion is that today we must fight to prevent the emission standards for dangerous waste being relaxed. The volume of waste to be incinerated is going to be significantly increased.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for example'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', None] ||| Denouncing racism, including racist talk, does not mean censoring the freedom of opinion as some would have us believe. Racism is not an opinion. It is a crime against human dignity. It is antisocial behaviour which can include physical attacks on individuals. ||| This has recently been seen in El Ejido in Spain and it also happened with the attacks on the homes of Turkish workers in Rostock and with the death of young Ibrahim Ali who was killed in Marseilles in 1995 by billposters of the French National Front. On each occasion, people were given the ideological arms to carry out the attacks.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I can give you two examples of this. Firstly, there is cause for concern about the shape being taken by the readmission agreements which directly threaten fundamental rights such as the right of asylum or the right to live as a family. ||| The Union has confirmed its attachment to the Geneva and Dublin Conventions by establishing the anti-deportation principle. It is therefore unacceptable that the readmission agreements can allow a third country national to be returned to his or her country when we know that this country more often than not does not guarantee respect for human rights and democratic freedoms.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The European Parliament is clearly not in tune with public opinion in several respects. Firstly, its position does not correspond to the demands of consumers who want clear labelling. ||| We have not granted them this labelling on chocolate. Parliament is also not in tune with public opinion which is becoming increasingly reticent about GMOs.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The current proposal therefore aims to give Member States the option of authorising the addition of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter to chocolate products up to a maximum of 5% of the total weight of the finished product. This has clearly succeeded in causing some occasionally stormy debates and has particularly revived legitimate concerns among consumers. ||| The latter felt particularly threatened some years ago when Europe, through certain harmonisation directives, tried to impose 'Euro-products' on us and they have demonstrated their desire to defend their culinary traditions. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| This is a distinctive label used throughout Europe which we want to imbue with renewed vigour. Like the French NF Environnement mark, this label is voluntary which means that it is up to manufacturers to apply for it. ||| It is based on the principle of a global approach which takes account of the whole life cycle of the product. However, we must not cast aside all the national logos.  Consumers and buyers have their own codes and have built up their confidence on the logos which they know.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'the reasons isare that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| With regard to municipal waste, I have several comments to make. Firstly, confusion should not be allowed about the definition of 'mixed municipal waste' in the context of co-incineration. ||| Likening 'partially separated waste' to 'untreated mixed municipal waste' , as Amendment No 14 does, risks affecting the development of the waste sorting sectors which we are trying to establish and in which some or all of the residues could be co-incinerated. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| At the time the majority of the waste was biodegradable which is far from being the case today. We have just been talking about chocolate. ||| This provides an ideal way of illustrating this issue by looking, for example, at the journey of the packaging of a chocolate bar from the dustbin to the incineration plant. From this we can see that the combustion of the aluminium foil produces toxic gases. We are facing an enormous challenge in terms of waste management.  However, I believe that some countries are not prepared for this either practically or theoretically.  One-third of domestic and similar waste treated by French disposal plants is currently handled by three hundred incinerators.

Ozone also contributes to asthmatic attacks, impaired lung function and increased bronchial reactivity. In the long term, this can even cause premature ageing of lungs. ||| These facts are frightening to say the least, which is why I warmly welcome this proposed directive. It aims to amend the existing Community legislation on ozone in accordance with the requirements of Council Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and management.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', None] ||| This proposed directive concerns national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants and comes under the framework directive on air quality. It is part of the Community's fifth Environmental Action Programme or EAP. ||| The main objective is to limit emissions of acidifying and eutrophying pollutants and ozone precursors in order to improve the protection of the environment and human health against adverse effects from acidification, soil eutrophication and tropospheric ozone. The ceilings indicated in this text must be complied with by 2010 at the latest.

We must move away from simple declarations of intent, no matter how positive they may be. ||| In view of the extremely high social expectations, we must urgently define measurable and verifiable objectives. What I would have liked to see was a commitment on the proposals indicated in my Group's motion such as:
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'earlier'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We must firstly set ambitious objectives. Those indicated in the Portuguese presidency's document are the return to full employment, stable growth, a genuine process of social cohesion, equal opportunities and the fight against poverty. ||| As underlined by the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Guterres, we were able to coordinate our economic policies to launch the euro. The European Union must now accept the challenge and proceed in a similar fashion by proposing guidelines for the policy on employment and social inclusion.

You know, taking a shot at a royal archduke is really a tough job. ||| It's not like a poacher taking a shot at the game warden. The problem is how to get to him.

To his surprise, this friendly man, who had been drinking beer right next to him just moments ago, turned over the lapel of his coat and showed him his "little eagle," the badge of the state security police. ||| He announced that he was arresting him and would immediately take him to headquarters. Švejk tried to explain that there must be some mistake, that he was totally innocent, that he had not uttered one word which could have offended anyone.

['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'afterwards'] ||| ['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', None] ||| So, just go ahead with gusto." Švejk slipped the belt into the gloomy man's hand. ||| He looked at the strap, threw it into a corner and started to weep.

You would have known that if you devoured them, the chief medical officer wouldn't believe that you were seriously sick.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'differentcon'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Doctor Grünstein ordered tersely:      "Give Švejk an extra enema."

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Such magnificent machinery is usually present and at the disposal of the government of any country approaching a comprehensive political, economic and moral crash.

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for instance'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| His sermons were unusual.

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left to hide that horrible scar. ||| Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.

The office was grey and dismal, and so was the courtyard, with a pile of broken bricks and rubble in one corner, several two- wheeled handcarts, a lot of dustbins, and not a touch of greenery anywhere. ||| The locker room seemed to me even more depressing. I sat down on a seat by the window which looked out on that dismal yard, clutching a small leather case which contained three small sweet buns, a book, and a notebook in which I was in the habit of jotting down anything that occurred to me in connection with what I was writing. Currently I was finishing an essay on Kafka.

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I had been living in a strange kind of exile for the previous ten years, hemmed in by prohibitions and guarded sometimes by visible, sometimes by invisible, and sometimes only by imagined watchers. I was not allowed to enter into life except as a guest, as a visitor, or as a day- wage labourer in selected jobs. ||| Over those years there grew within me a longing for something to happen, something that would change my life, while at the same time my timidity, which I had inherited from my mother, increased and made me shy away from any kind of change and from all strangers. Thus my home became for me both a refuge and a cage, I wanted to remain in it and yet also to flee from it; to have the certainty that I would not be driven out and also the hope that I ’d escape one day.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'specifically'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I knew of course that the children would very soon grow up and leave home, that the ring of their footsteps was even more temporary than my own temporariness. I talked to them and shared their joys, but I felt them slipping away and I knew that I must not resist that movement if I was not to resist life. I was also watching my wife seeking her own space to move in, trying to escape the deadening monotony of the work she had to do and to study in her spare time. ||| She had decided that she ’d try to understand what the human soul was, penetrate its secret in the hope of finding a way of alleviating its suffering. To me such an enterprise appeared almost too daring, and besides I was always seeing her as she was when I first met her, too childlike and with too little experience of life to master such an undertaking, but I encouraged her : everybody sets out in the direction from which he hears at least the hint of a calling.

Even of this stocky old man with his grey, slightly tobacco- stained moustache I was unable to report anything remarkable, except possibly that, like his ancestors, he stubbornly believed in the coming of the Messiah, but for him that meant the mirage of the socialist revolution. ||| That mirage helped him survive the blows of fate, the death of his wife, the loss of his home, his humiliation, hunger and the hardships of imprisonment. More and more often in that unhappy place he would preach to anyone who would listen to him, and more and more often I would be the only listener to remain.

My father lifted me up on his shoulders. ||| He didn’t even say : Poor little boy, he didn’t reprimand me, he just carried me and on the way showed me the trains which flashed by below us, giving them their names, just as if they were relations or children. He carried me as far as the wooden footbridge over the railway line and said I could spit down into the funnel of a locomotive if one came along. When at last one came, spewing sparks and smoke, he himself leant over the railing to set an example for me, and the powerful rush of smoke and steam emitted by the funnel lifted his hat off his head and all we could do was to watch it sail down to settle on a pile of coal on one of the wagons and disappear with it in the distance. Dad laughed and said his hat was an acrobat too, and I, gazing delightedly after the vanishing hat, forgot the terrors of my flight.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'to provide some background information'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Then one day before Christmas we first made love in a tiny attic room with small windows and thick walls under the roof of a baroque building. Facing it was a noble town house with enormous windows on the sills of which sat some freezing pigeons. ||| There was a smell of oil in the room, as well as the faint odour of gas, and though it was midday the room was quite dark. The small windows were moreover partly obstructed by a statue of Saint Stephen the Martyr. The restoration of the statue was nearly complete, but my lover had stopped working on it, she didn’t like having her hand controlled by someone else’s instructions.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'during that time'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I ’d walk behind them, without the child being aware of me. I ’d sink into the freshly fallen snow because I wasn’t looking where I was going, I was watching her walking : there was in her walk something of an ill- concealed hurry, or maybe of an eagerness for life. ||| She was holding her little girl’s hand and only occasionally did she glance behind. Even at that distance I could feel her love.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| She was assigned to a transport, as were nearly all the occupants of our barracks. She ran out from the room, which was filled with confusion and tears, where the pitiful remains of the inmates ’ belongings were being sorted out and packed in a hopeless hurry; she only had a moment, she wanted to be with her mother who was in despair. ||| We knew of a spot in the recess of the ramparts, the slope there was overgrown with grass and shaded by ancient lime trees. It was quieter there than anywhere else in the fortress.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I awoke in terror, afraid to go to sleep again, and my eyes roamed feverishly through the empty darkness. At that time I slept in the kitchen, near the gas cooker. ||| I ’d get up time and again to make sure no gas was escaping. It was clear to me that I had only been spared through some oversight, some omission that might be put right at any moment.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'specifically'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', None] ||| The sorcerer replied : I may look old but I shan’t die because my soul does not reside in my body. When she wanted to know where his soul resided he explained to her that it was a long way away. ||| Over the mountains, beyond the rivers, there was a lake, and in the middle of it an island, and on the island a temple, a temple without windows and with just one door, and that door could not be opened. Inside a bird was flying around, and unless someone killed it it would never die, and in it was the sorcerer’s soul.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'the reasons isare that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| She ’d stopped studying, she ’d stopped caring for herself, I wouldn’t believe how much she ’d gone down over the past few weeks. For a while my wife continued to tell me about the girl whose future was worrying her. ||| My wife always took on the burdens of her patients. She ’d try to help them, and she ’d torment herself if she failed.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', None] ||| But then this didn’t bother her, she didn’t need me as a writer, she wasn’t going to read any book of mine anyway. I recently read an article in an American weekly about how fourteen complete idiots incapable of speech had learned ‘ jerkish ’. ||| That was the name of a language of 225 words, developed in Atlanta for mutual communications between humans and chimpanzees – and there was no doubt, the author of the article believed, that more and more unfortunate creatures would be able to talk to each other in jerkish. It occurred to me immediately that at last a language had been found in which the spirit of our age could speak, and because that language would spread rapidly from pole to pole, to the east and to the west, it would be the language of the future.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I could hear nothing but a barely perceptible snapping sound as some of the individual threads broke, and I longed to discover some hope I could attach myself to. That was when she appeared. ||| If we had met at some other time we ’d probably have passed each other by, but at just that moment I raced after her like a man drugged, and it took years for me to come to again. At the same time I never stopped conducting a silent argument with her. Even when I longed for her most my words died in my throat the moment she looked at me, whenever the night separated me from her embracing and comforting glance I would compose answers to questions, reproaches, wishes and yearnings which until then I had left unanswered.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I am fond of my native city, not only of the part through which the tourist crowds stroll, but also of the outskirts, where, among blocks of flats from the Secession period, a few little rural houses have remained standing, either forgotten or, more probably, already sentenced to death in some development plans, where unexpectedly an avenue of ancient poplars has survived or a little wooded hill, or fences bearing appeals and announcements whose bright colours I was aware of but whose texts as a rule I didn’t read. More than once, as I pushed my cart with the dustbin I discovered a faded plaque on some familiar and usually dingy wall, a bust, or even a memorial huddling in some recess. ||| These were meant to remind us that here, years ago, was born, lived or died some artist, thinker, scientist or national figure, in other words a spirit of whom it might be presumed that he rose above the rest of us. But more often, in one of those little streets or among the fading gardens, I remembered that here lived someone I knew, an artist, a thinker, a scientist or a national figure, someone who was here no more, someone beyond the hills and beyond the rivers, though mostly not over the river Styx, which would be sad but the common human lot, but someone now a refugee, someone driven out to our common shame.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| He was quite a pleasant and amusing fellow. I couldn’t see anything odd in his appearance, anything that might make me doubt his sincerity. ||| He merely had a deeper tan than would be usual for that time of the year, but he told me he ’d just returned from the shores of Africa. Out there, even at night- time when he couldn’t sleep because of the heat, he had reflected on the curious and dangerous imbalance of the planet.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', None] ||| I hurriedly drank a cup of coffee and then we went out by the back door into his yard. I noticed that the snow which had fallen that morning had none of the usual deathly whiteness about it, but was dirty grey. ||| My guide didn’t even look about him but hurried to a shed behind the house, opened its wide double door, and wheeled out his machinery. Unlike the house itself this was an object of impressive appearance.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'notably'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| He unrolled the first sheet and I saw a dreamlike ship whose deck was taken up by turrets carrying windmill sails, five turrets in all. He showed me further drawings, among them a windmill bus and a flying windmill, all these craft driven by wind. ||| The drawings were meticulously done, the individual parts all bearing letters and numbers : I recognised the drive assembly, the transmission gears and the blades of the propellers as I knew them from childhood from my father’s drawings. Other drawings had landscapes dotted with wooden turrets towering picturesquely above the tops of the trees.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| He was going downhill. One day, when he was cutting a sheet of metal with a welding torch, he ’d handled it so awkwardly that the cut strip fell and crushed his hand. ||| They had to amputate it at the wrist. So he ’d been transferred to storekeeping. There, now and again, some idea would come to him.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability. That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions- and there are already some- relating to the issue of traceability. ||| Once that is done, issues such as liability can be addressed. I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background, but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'subsequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama. I urge the Chinese again to do so. ||| We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities. 
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'afterwards'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal. Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition; a new, reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office. ||| Speaking in this House on 21 July President- designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform, which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'at that time'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| This was just a procedural motion. Let me remind you, Mr Wurtz, that we shall be seeing Mr Prodi tomorrow. ||| He is going to make a statement on the Commission's programme. Naturally you will be perfectly free to ask him questions in the speeches you make following this statement, just as Mr Prodi will be perfectly free to answer you.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'even though'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day- to- day ones. At the same time, however, it has to be said that, unfortunately, your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto. ||| There are a lot of good intentions in it, but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved. As in any other party manifesto, it is full of contradictions.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had an in- depth discussion on the URBAN initiative which produced many ideas. As the smallest Community initiative in existence, we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was rejected. ||| We regret this as there was actually money left over from the Structural Funds in some countries which could really have helped with pilot projects. We should remember that it is these URBAN projects which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be established.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'differentcon'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The situation of Turkey's relations with its neighbours will, as the honourable Member asks, be closely examined in the framework of the pre- accession strategy.

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'considering this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Because of shoddy drafting the Convention can be interpreted very widely, and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 18 allows interception in another Member State without its involvement. ||| Not only should this be deleted, the whole interception title should be scrapped. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| These events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism, xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated. It is incomprehensible that ways of coexisting and ensuring mutual respect can not be found between two communities which are mutually beneficial. ||| The only way to prevent these events happening again, in a place where there are large communities of immigrant workers, is through social integration. This requires a firm economic, political and social commitment from the competent authorities.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| First of all I should like to thank Mr Viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report. It is a very extensive report. ||| We greatly welcome it, just as we welcomed the original report that it was based on, the report of the high- level working group which was set up by the European Commission. I hope that the Commission will not forget that.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'on the contrary'] ||| ['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', None] ||| I am very fond of him. He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners. ||| It is a pity I can not say the same for some of his other colleagues. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for example'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| By that, I do not think they mean what you have just termed the Keynesian school of thought of yesteryear, Mr von Wogau, for no one wants a lack of stability or solidity, rather we must at last find the right policy mix here in the European Union. This involves both supply- and demand- orientated measures. ||| We see this in other countries of the world that have been pursuing this very strategy for many years now, and which are more successful than your homeland, for example. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We have taken a website that will enable us, I hope, to inform the NGO community and others more clearly about what is available. We intend establishing a multi- annual work plan. ||| We will refer to that on our website. I hope, therefore, that NGOs will feel involved in what we are doing.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'considering this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I would like the Commissioner to reassure me that, when the campaign is decentralised, information offices in the Member States will involve Members of the European Parliament in the information campaign as a matter of course. After all, it is the MEPs who are supposed to represent the citizens. ||| We are at least as well- placed as the Commission to engage in that dialogue with the citizens. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'bearing this in mind'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Many of us believe that any government in our country will encourage the construction of waste incinerators as an alternative to encouraging the alternatives. It would be a case of " throw it on the furnace"and putting it out of sight and out of mind which to my mind is a false approach. ||| We have to concentrate on reducing waste, recycling what is left and leaving incinerators as a last resort. 
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| You will know that in the case of the UK, at a moderation seminar, the Commission agreed a timetable to allow for review and inclusion of additional sites. In Paris a timetable was set to allow for a revised list to be presented in July with another moderation in October 2000. ||| We are determined, after years of foot- dragging by the previous Conservative Government- Mrs Jackson's party- to meet our requirements in the UK, in good faith, to follow the proper legal and proper consultation to ensure this directive is complied with. 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  Unlike the last speaker I would like to congratulate you, Commissioner, on your threat to cut off European funding. ||| It should not just be an idle threat. You should carry it out if Member States do not act responsibly.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'in particular'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| This is not about the implementation of the habitats directive. Remember that the directive is not an effort directive, it is a result directive. ||| This is about meeting our obligations under the Structural Funds regulation and without these lists we can not ensure that we protect important natural sites during Structural Funds operations. That is what this is about.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| They include the right to personal and political freedom and basic social and economic rights. The idea of human rights is one of the most exalted ideas which mankind has ever had and has its roots in the concentration camps and gulags of the last century. ||| It appeals to everything which makes man a human being and which makes him aware of his dignity, uniqueness, freedom and equality with other men. The way in which human rights have spread illustrates the fact that this human image has huge powers to project and concern for human dignity is at the core of any human rights policy.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| It is the most extreme versions of racism on the edges of Europe which we are disturbed about. When the debate about Austria- which has many elements, many complexities- was unfolding we realised that on the edges of Austria there were significant candidate countries which, while they were making progress in economic, progress in social aspects, represented a real problem with regard to their treatment of minorities. ||| In Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary there were significant problems with the treatment of the Roma. What we must realise is that, as we enlarge Europe, we have a significant responsibility for ensuring that any country that wishes to join the European Union must also reform the way that it treats minorities and the way that it treats the whole question of race discrimination.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'specifically'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Mr President, I should like to make a point of order. We voted on this report in committee, a committee on which all groups are represented. ||| We dealt with 170 amendments to this report in committee. We have now been presented with 66 amendments in plenary.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'accordingly'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| We know that a lot of people will leave this afternoon. They do not expect this kind of vote on a Thursday afternoon. ||| Could we not postpone it until the April plenary session in Strasbourg? 
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The text of the Charter for Peace and Stability should be agreed at the meeting in mid- November.

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'considering the fact that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| It is important even at this early stage that we have a clear strategy on how the institutions will respond to the accession of new members. We need to be imaginative about how we address the issues of staffing and building requirements. ||| The institutions can not respond to enlargement by just adding an extra post here or an office there. We do not want a Lego approach to enlargement.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| He despised technical details, because details meant difficulties, and difficulties meant ruffling his composure, and he simply would not put up with that.

Slowly he straightened up, and as he did he breathed the scent of milk and cheesy wool exuded by the wet nurse.

But not so the nose. ||| While the child's dull eyes squinted into the void, the nose seemed to fix on a particular target, and Terrier had the very odd feeling that he himself, his person, Father Terrier, was that target. The tiny wings of flesh around the two tiny holes in the child's face swelled like a bud opening to bloom.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| But on the inside she was long since dead. When she was a child, her father had struck her across the forehead with a poker, just above the base of the nose, and she had lost for good all sense of smell and every sense of human warmth and human coldness - indeed, every human passion. ||| With that one blow, tenderness had become as foreign to her as enmity, joy as strange as despair. She felt nothing when later she slept with a man, and just as little when she bore her children.

She did not grieve over those that died, nor rejoice over those that remained to her.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'on the contrary'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| That cry, emitted upon careful consideration, one might almost say upon mature consideration, was the newborn's decision AGAINST love and nevertheless FOR life. Under the circumstances, the latter was possible only without the former, and had the child demanded both, it would doubtless have abruptly come to a grisly end. ||| Of course, it could have grabbed the other possibility open to it and held its peace and thus have chosen the path from birth to death without a detour by way of life, sparing itself and the world a great deal of mischief. But to have made such a modest exit would have demanded a modicum of native civility, and that Grenouille did not possess.

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| And only then does it abandon caution and drop and scratch and bore and bite into that alien flesh ... The young Grenouille was such a tick. ||| He lived encapsulated in himself and waited for better times.

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', None] ||| The top logs gave off a sweet burnt smell, and up from the depths of the cord came a mossy aroma; in the warm sun, aromatic flakes of resin odour crumbled from the pine- wood planking of the shed.

The rod of punishment awaiting him he bore without a whimper of pain. ||| Confining him to the house, denying him meals, sentencing him to hard labour - nothing could change his behaviour.

During the day he worked as long as there was light - eight hours in winter, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen hours in summer.  He scraped the meat from bestially stinking hides, watered them down, plucked them, limed, bated and fulled them, rubbed them down with pickling dung, chopped wood, stripped bark from birch and yew, climbed down into the tanning pits filled with caustic fumes, layered the hides and pelts just as the journeymen ordered him, spread them with smashed gallnuts, covered this ghastly funeral pyre with yew branches and earth.  Years later, he would have to dig them up again and retrieve these mummified hide carcasses - now tanned leather - from their grave.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| The goal of the hunt was simply to possess everything the world could offer in the way of odours, and his only condition was that the odours be new ones. The smell of a sweating horse meant just as much to him as the tender green bouquet of a bursting rosebud, the acrid stench of a bug was no less worthy than the aroma rising from a larded veal roast in an aristocrat's kitchen. ||| He devoured everything, everything, sucking it up into him. But there were no aesthetic principles governing the olfactory kitchen of his imagination, where he was forever synthesizing and concocting new aromatic combinations.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| But above it hovered the ribbon, delicate and clear, leading Grenouille on.

['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', None] ||| Totally uninteresting, repulsive - that was how humans smelled ... And so it happened that for the first time in his life, Grenouille did not trust his nose and had to call on his eyes for assistance if he was to believe what he smelled. ||| This confusion of senses did not last long at all. Actually he required only a moment to convince himself optically - then to abandon himself all the more ruthlessly to olfactory perception.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| First he must seal up his innermost compartments.  Then he stood up and blew out the candle. Meanwhile people were starting home, singing and hurrahing their way up the rue de Seine. ||| Grenouille smelled his way down the dark alley and out on to the rue des Petits Augustins, which lay parallel to the rue de Seine and led to the river. A little while later, the dead girl was discovered.

He had found the compass for his future life.

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'bearing this in mind'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| Chenier would swear himself to silence, and tonight they would perfume Count Verhamont's leather with the other man's product. That was how it would be, no doubt of it, and Chenier only wished that the whole circus were already over. ||| Baldini was no longer a great perfumer. At one time, to be sure, in his youth, thirty, forty years ago, he had composed 'Rose of the South' and 'Baldini's Gallant Bouquet', the two truly great perfumes to which he owed his fortune.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'bearing this in mind'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| He had inherited 'Rose of the South' from his father, and the formula for 'Baldini's Gallant Bouquet' had been bought from a travelling Genoese spice salesman.

On the death of old Count Philibert, he became the head of one of the oldest and most distinguished families in France, whose arms dated back to the fourteenth century.

['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'subsequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| He read Christine's note over and over again, smelling its perfume, recalling the sweet pictures of his childhood, and spent the rest of that tedious night journey in feverish dreams that began and ended with Christine Daae. Day was breaking when he alighted at Lannion. ||| He hurried to the diligence for Perros- Guirec. He was the only passenger.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'during that time'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| He never went out of doors in Paris, but lived in a sort of dream which he kept up with his violin. For hours at a time, he remained locked up in his bedroom with his daughter, fiddling and singing, very, very softly. Sometimes Mamma Valerius would come and listen behind the door, wipe away a tear and go down- stairs again on tiptoe, sighing for her Scandinavian skies. Daae seemed not to recover his strength until the summer, when the whole family went to stay at Perros- Guirec, in a far- away corner of Brittany, where the sea was of the same color as in his own country. ||| Often he would play his saddest tunes on the beach and pretend that the sea stopped its roaring to listen to them. And then he induced Mamma Valerius to indulge a queer whim of his. At the time of the " pardons,"or Breton pilgrimages, the village festival and dances, he went off with his fiddle, as in the old days, and was allowed to take his daughter with him for a week.

Then they made their way through the front rows of stalls and looked at Box Five on the grand tier, They could not see it well, because it was half in darkness and because great covers were flung over the red velvet of the ledges of all the boxes. They were almost alone in the huge, gloomy house; and a great silence surrounded them. ||| It was the time when most of the stage- hands go out for a drink.

Richard, ostensibly highly amused and laughing at each other, moved the furniture of the box, lifted the cloths and the chairs and particularly examined the arm- chair in which " the man's voice"used to sit. But they saw that it was a respectable arm- chair, with no magic about it. ||| Altogether, the box was the most ordinary box in the world, with its red hangings, its chairs, its carpet and its ledge covered in red velvet. After, feeling the carpet in the most serious manner possible, and discovering nothing more here or anywhere else, they went down to the corresponding box on the pit tier below.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Meanwhile, in Box Five, Moncharmin and Richard had turned very pale.

Marie would give me money, right away, all she had, and she would come to me and stand by me, especially when she heard of the series of failures that had befallen me, but she wouldn’t come alone.

If Mother knew about them, Father did too, and so did Leo, and through Leo Züpfner, the whole group and Marie. ||| It would be a terrible blow for her, worse than for me. If I gave up drinking entirely again, I would soon be once more on the level which Zohnerer, my agent, called “nicely above average,” and that would be enough to carry me through the twenty-two years I still had to go till I reached the gutter.

I was dead tired, glad I was able to think of that wretched Gunther without getting into a panic, and then began to feel scared something might have happened to Marie. ||| At school they used to tell terrible stories. It was not pleasant lying there on the mattress without sheets, it was old and lumpy, I had nothing on but my undershirt and I felt cold.

On this particular morning in her room I would have liked to go on lying in bed indefinitely and could have wished she would never finish getting dressed. ||| She washed her neck, arms and breasts thoroughly and brushed her teeth vigorously.

A dear old aunt can teach you how to knit sweaters, crochet little doilies, and serve sherry—but I wouldn’t expect her to make a witty and knowledgeable two-hour speech on homosexuality or to suddenly start talking like a floozy. ||| False hopes, false modesty, false speculation on the unnatural. It wouldn’t surprise me if even the papal nuncio began complaining about the shortage of floozies.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| No doubt he had said, “Write Schnier off,” and so she simply wrote me off. She was under his thumb, and as long as he had believed I was useful in some way, she had been allowed to follow her natural instincts and be nice to me, now contrary to her instincts she had to be unkind to me. But maybe I was doing them an injustice, and they were both merely following the dictates of their conscience. ||| If Marie was married to Züpfner, it was no doubt sinful to arrange a contact between us—that Züpfner was the man in the Executive Committee and could be useful to Fredebeul didn’t interfere with their conscience. Doubtless they must do what was right and proper even when it was to their advantage.

After all, she had to do something with him, go out dancing or play cards, he had to read aloud to her or she to him, and she had to talk to him too, about the weather or about money. ||| Actually the only thing she could do for him without having to think of me all the time was cook, for she did this so rarely for me that it would not necessarily be treason or whoring. I felt like phoning Sommerwild right away, but it was still too early, I had made up my mind to wake him up at two thirty in the morning and have a long talk with him about art.

The phone went on ringing, manly, vigorous, virile, I was just about to throw a sofa cushion over it—but I pulled on my bathrobe, went into the living room, and stopped in front of the ringing telephone. ||| Managers have strong nerves, persistence, words like “sensitiveness of the artistic soul” are to them words like “Lager Beer,” and any attempt to talk seriously to them about art and artists would be just waste of breath. They also know perfectly well that even an unscrupulous artist has a thousand times more conscience than a scrupulous manager, and they possess one all-conquering weapon: the sheer knowledge of the fact that an artist simply cannot help doing what he does: painting pictures, traveling up and down the country as a clown, singing songs, carving something “enduring” out of stone or granite. An artist is like a woman who can do nothing but love, and who succumbs to every stray male jackass.

I prayed it might never happen: breakfast with Züpfner.

That is a matter of grace, or to put it in banal terms, sheer good fortune. ||| The young man to whom it does happen starts out with an advantage, just as it is an advantage to be endowed with felicitous qualities of body and soul. Almost all elite pupils regard their election as a piece of great good fortune, a distinction they are proud of, and a great many of them have previously felt an ardent longing for that distinction.

We set out, and it must have been an unusually beautiful day in the world or in my own mind, for it has remained in my memory, and vouchsafed me a little experience. The ground was wet, but free of snow; strong green shoots were already breaking through on the edge of streams. Buds and the first opening catkins were already lending a tinge of color to the bare bushes, and the air was full of scent, a scent imbued with life and with contradictions.

Mostly, he merely set themes and showed the way by example. ||| Knecht observed the way the Master often looked so old and worn out, but after sinking into himself with half-closed eyes he would once again manage to look so tranquil, vigorous, cheerful, and friendly. To Joseph this renewal was a persuasive demonstration of the right way to the true springs, the way from restiveness to peace.

The Master, as he was bidding good-by to Joseph, said to him: In a few days you will learn which school you have been assigned to. I come to the higher schools less frequently than to Eschholz, but I am sure we shall see each other there too, if I keep in good health. ||| If you care to, you might write me a letter once a year, especially about the course of your musical studies. Criticism of your teachers is not prohibited, but I am not so concerned about that.

The other boys called him "Rice Eater" and prized him for his aptitude at sports. ||| His friendship with Joseph began with talks about music and led to joint studying and practicing which continued for several years; we are informed about this partly by Knecht's rare but copious letters to the Music Master. In the first of these letters Knecht calls Ferromonte a "specialist and connoisseur in music rich in ornamentation, embellishments, trills, etc."

We must now give some account of that other fellow student who played a significant part in Knecht's life at Waldzell: the hospitant Plinio Designori. ||| Hospitants were boys who went through the elite schools as guests, that is, without the intention of remaining permanently in the Pedagogic Province and entering the Order. Such hospitants turned up every so often, although they were quite rare, for the Board of Educators was naturally averse to the idea of educating students who intended to return home and into the world after they finished their studies at the elite schools.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The latter, he decided, were much too one-sided; in this regard the headmaster had been right, and he insisted that Knecht admit as much to the headmaster. He gave precise directives for Knecht's conduct toward Designori, and did not leave until this question, too, had been discussed with Headmaster Zbinden. ||| The outcome was twofold: that remarkable joust between Designori and Knecht, which none who looked on would ever forget; and an entirely new relationship between Knecht and the headmaster. Not that this relationship ever partook of the affection and mystery that linked Knecht to the Music Master, but at least it was lucid and relaxed.

The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard — it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name.

Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others — poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner — young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy to say. James Gatz — that was really, or at least legally, his name. ||| He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career — when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the Tuolomee, and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.

Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. ||| The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised.

['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', None] ||| It is a solemn moment. Our object is, I take it, well known to us all. ||| To the estimable Mr. Baggins, and perhaps to one or two of the younger dwarves (I think I should be right in naming Kili and Fili, for instance), the exact situation at the moment may require a little brief explanation -" This was Thorin's style.

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'later'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| In those days of our tale there were still some people who had both elves and heroes of the North for ancestors, and Elrond the master of the house was their chief.

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for example'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', None] ||| He knew that something unexpected might happen, and he hardly dared to hope that they would pass without fearful adventure over those great tall mountains with lonely peaks and valleys where no king ruled.  They did not. All was well, until one day they met a thunderstorm - more than a thunderstorm, a thunder-battle. ||| You know how terrific a really big thunderstorm can be down in the land and in a river-valley; especially at times when two great thunderstorms meet and clash. More terrible still are thunder and lightning in the mountains at night, when storms come up from East and West and make war.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Of course he gave a very loud yell, as loud a yell as a hobbit can give, which is surprising for their size. Out jumped the goblins, big goblins, great ugly-looking goblins, lots of goblins, before you could say rocks and blocks. ||| There were six to each dwarf, at least, and two even for Bilbo; and they were all grabbed and carried through the crack, before you could say tinder and flint. But not Gandalf.  Bilbo's yell had done that much good.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'the reasons isare that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| But not Gandalf. Bilbo's yell had done that much good. ||| It had wakened him up wide in a splintered second, and when goblins came to grab him, there was a terrible flash like lightning in the cave, a smell like gunpowder, and several of them fell dead. The crack closed with a snap, and Bilbo and the dwarves were on the wrong side of it!
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| It was a turning point in his career, but he did not know it. He put the ring in his pocket almost without thinking; certainly it did not seem of any particular use at the moment. ||| He did not go much further, but sat down on the cold floor and gave himself up to complete miserableness, for a long while. He thought of himself frying bacon and eggs in his own kitchen at home - for he could feel inside that it was high time for some meal or other; but that only made him miserabler.  He could not think what to do; nor could he think what had happened; or why he had been left behind; or why, if he had been left behind, the goblins had not caught him; or even why his head was so sore.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'incidentally'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Of these he took no notice, except to hurry past for fear of goblins or half-imagined dark things coming out of them. On and on he went, and down and down; and still he heard no sound of anything except the occasional whirr of a bat by his ears, which startled him at first, till it became too frequent to bother about. ||| I do not know how long he kept on like this, hating to go on, not daring to stop, on, on, until he was tireder than tired. It seemed like all the way to tomorrow and over it to the days beyond.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', None] ||| I don't know where he came from, nor who or what he was. He was Gollum - as dark as darkness, except for two big round pale eyes in his thin face. ||| He had a little boat, and he rowed about quite quietly on the lake; for lake it was, wide and deep and deadly cold. He paddled it with large feet dangling over the side, but never a ripple did he make.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| Poor Bilbo sat in the dark thinking of all the horrible names of all the giants and ogres he had ever heard told of in tales, but not one of them had done all these things. He had a feeling that the answer was quite different and that he ought to know it, but he could not think of it. ||| He began to get frightened, and that is bad for thinking. Gollum began to get out of his boat.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Bilbo hurried after him, still cautiously, though his chief fear now was of tripping on another snag and falling with a noise. His head was in a whirl of hope and wonder. ||| It seemed that the ring he had was a magic ring: it made you invisible! He had heard of such things, of course, in old old tales; but it was hard to believe that he really had found one, by accident.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'even so'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| We must wait here, precious, wait a bit and see. So they came to a dead stop. ||| Gollum had brought Bilbo to the way out after all, but Bilbo could not get in!

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'the reasons isare that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Gollum was defeated. He dared go no further. ||| He had lost: lost his prey, and lost, too, the only thing he had ever cared for, his precious. The cry brought Bilbo's heart to his mouth, but still he held on.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite the fact that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| It was answered by another away to the right and a good deal nearer to them; then by another not far away to the left. It was wolves howling at the moon, wolves gathering together! ||| There were no wolves living near Mr. Baggins' hole at home, but he knew that noise. He had had it described to him often enough in tales.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| So Dori actually climbed out of the tree and let Bilbo scramble up and stand on his back. Just at that moment the wolves trotted howling into the clearing. ||| All of a sudden there were hundreds of eyes looking at them. Still Dori did not let Bilbo down.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The reason, no doubt, was the death of the Great Goblin, and all the excitement caused by the dwarves and Bilbo and the wizard, for whom they were probably still hunting. In spite of the dangers of this far land bold men had of late been making their way back into it from the South, cutting down trees, and building themselves places to live in among the more pleasant woods in the valleys and along the river-shores. ||| There were many of them, and they were brave and well-armed, and even the Wargs dared not attack them if there were many together, or in the bright day. But now they had planned with the goblins' help to come by night upon some of the villages nearest the mountains.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'to sum up'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Each proposes to the other that something be repeated and each accepts the others proposal. Their mutual indifference to each others slogans is only an illusion: in reality, by exhibiting their slogans, each compels the other to accept the rules of the game and to confirm thereby the power that requires the slogans in the first place. ||| Quite simply, each helps the other to be obedient. Both are objects in a system of control, but at the same time they are its subjects as well.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'specifically'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| It must do so because the logic of its automatism and self-defense dictate it.

He has exposed it as a mere game.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| On the one hand, there was the sterile puritanism of the posttotalitarian establishment and, on the other hand, unknown young people who wanted no more than to be able to live within the truth, to play the music they enjoyed, to sing songs that were relevant to their lives, and to live freely in dignity and partnership. These people had no past history of political activity. ||| They were not highly motivated members of the opposition with political ambitions, nor were they former politicians expelled from the power structures. They had been given every opportunity to adapt to the status quo, to accept the principles of living within a lie and thus to enjoy life undisturbed by the authorities.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Their theoretical concepts can be interesting and instructive to us, but one thing is certain: we cannot solve our problems simply by identifying with these organizations. And the attempt in our country to place what we do in the context of some of the discussions that dominate political life in democratic societies often seems like sheer folly. For example, is it possible to talk seriously about whether we want to change the system or merely reform it? In the circumstances under which we live, this is a pseudo-problem, since for the time being there is simply no way we can accomplish either goal. ||| We are not even clear about where reform ends and change begins. We know from a number of harsh experiences that neither reform nor change is in itself a guarantee of anything.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'the reasons isare that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Its purpose is to render a service and its meaning does not lie in the law itself. Establishing respect for the law does not automatically ensure a better life for that, after all, is a job for people and not for laws and institutions. ||| It is possible to imagine a society with good laws that are fully respected but in which it is impossible to live. Conversely, one can imagine life being quite bearable even where the laws are imperfect and imperfectly applied.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for instance'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Adaptation is the positive dimension of the regim s response, and it can, and usually does, have a wide spectrum of forms and phases. Some circles may try to integrate values of people from the “parallel world” into the official structures, to appropriate them, to become a little like them while trying to make them a little like themselves, and thus to adjust an obvious and untenable imbalance. ||| In the 1960s, progressive communists began to “discover” certain unacknowledged cultural values and phenomena. This was a positive step, al though not without its dangers, since the “integrated” or “appropriated” values lost something of their independence and originality, and having been given a cloak of officiality and conformity, their credibility was somewhat weakened.

At Dino’s place, she drank Cherry Cokes in summer and mugs of hot chocolate with marshmallows in winter.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'in contrast'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| But when the elderly Italian took my money and handed me the drinks, there was no spark of recognition in his weary eyes.

Fanny was the first girl I’d ever dated, back when I was fourteen and in the ninth grade. ||| We went to see a Saturday matinee of Rain Man, and, on the bus back to La Fontonne, both listening to the headphones of my Sony Walkman, we exchanged four or five awkward kisses between Jean-Jacques Goldman singing “Puisque tu pars” and Mylène Farmer crooning “Pourvu qu’elles soient douces.” We stayed together until junior year, at which point we drifted apart, though we remained friends.

After some minutes the local picture houses disgorged their audiences. ||| I noticed that the young fellows coming from them were taking longer strides and gesturing more vigorously than at ordinary times; doubtless the picture they'd been seeing was of the wild- West variety. Those who had been to the picture houses in the middle of the town came a little later, and looked more sedate, though a few were still laughing.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'afterwards'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I once brought this to my employer's notice. It was regrettable, he agreed  but, to his mind, a mere detail. ||| I left the office building a little later than usual, at half-past twelve, with Emmanuel, who works in the Forwarding Department. Our building overlooks the sea, and we paused for a moment on the steps to look at the shipping in the.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Yesterday was Saturday, and Marie came as we'd arranged. She had a very pretty dress, with red and white stripes, and leather sandals, and I couldn't take my eyes off her. ||| One could see the outline of her firm little breasts, and her sun-tanned face was like a velvety brown flower. We took the bus and went to a beach I know, some miles out of Algiers.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| She agreed, and I went down to buy some meat. On my way back I heard a woman's voice in Raymond's room. ||| A little later old Salamano started grumbling at his dog and presently there was a sound of boots and paws on the wooden stairs; then, Filthy brute! Get on, you cur!" and the two of them went out into the street.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I mentioned this to Marie, but she paid no attention. She was carrying an oilcloth bag in which she had stowed our bathing kit and a towel. ||| Presently we heard Raymond shutting his door. He was wearing blue trousers, a short-sleeved white shirt, and a straw hat.

The two natives backed away slowly, keeping us at bay with the knife and never taking their eyes off us.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'in short'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The result was that our relations became more cordial. After a few questions, followed by an exchange of remarks with the lawyer, the magistrate closed the interview. ||| My case was "taking its course," as he put it. Sometimes, too, the conversation was of a general order, and the magistrate and lawyer encouraged me to join in it. I began to breathe more freely.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Between the two grilles there was a gap of some thirty feet, a sort of no man's land between the prisoners and their friends. I was led to a point exactly opposite Marie, who was wearing her striped dress. ||| On my side of the rails were about a dozen other prisoners, Arabs for the most part. On Marie's side were mostly Moorish women.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', None] ||| So my keeper can't possibly be my enemy. I 've grown fond of this man peeping through the door, and the moment he enters my room I tell him incidents from my life so he can get to know me in spite of the peephole between us. ||| The good fellow seems to appreciate my stories, for the moment I 've finished some tall tale he expresses his gratitude by showing me one of his latest knotworks. Whether he's an artist remains to be seen.

From Modlin to Kiev — up the Bug, through the canal linking the Bug and the Pripet, till the Radaune, following the Pripet, made its way to the Dnieper — nothing passed between Koljaiczek- Wranka and Dückerhoff that could be recorded as an exchange. ||| It's of course possible that things happened on the tug, among the raftsmen, between the raftsmen and the stokers, between the stokers, the helmsman, and the captain, between the captain and the constantly changing pilots, as one assumes, perhaps rightly, they always do among men. I could imagine disputes between the Kashubian raftsmen and the helmsman, who came from Stettin, perhaps even the beginnings of a mutiny : a meeting in the galley, lots drawn, passwords given out, frog stickers sharpened.

The flat, which adjoined the store, was cramped and poorly laid out, but compared with living conditions on Troyl, which I 've only heard stories about, it was sufficiently middle- class that Mama, at least during the early years of her marriage, must have felt comfortable on Labesweg. In addition to a long, slightly crooked hall, stacked for the most part with boxes of Persil, there was a spacious kitchen, though it too was half- filled with goods such as canned food, sacks of flour, and packets of oatmeal. ||| The central feature of the ground- floor flat was a living room that looked out through two windows onto the street and a front garden area adorned in summer with Baltic seashells. The wallpaper held a good deal of wine red, while the couch verged on purple.

The entire wedding party crowds into other prints. ||| Amid the urbanely dressed guests striking various attitudes, my grandmother Anna and her blessed brother Vinzent are always conspicuous for their stern provinciality and guileless insecurity. Jan Bronski, who like my mama comes from the same potato field as his aunt Anna and his heavenly- Virgin- addicted father, manages to hide his rural Kashubian origins behind the festive elegance of a Polish postal clerk.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'specifically'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| That's enough for now about these three, who brought me into the world although they lacked for nothing. Before I come to myself, a word about Mama's friend Gretchen Schemer and her master- baker husband, Alexander Schemer. ||| He baldheaded, she laughing with equine teeth, a good half of which were gold. He stubby- legged, never reaching the carpet when he sat on chairs, she in clothes she knitted herself in patterns that could never be busy enough.

You see me with clenched fists. ||| No little sausage fingers playing absent- mindedly with tufts of polar- bear rug in response to some still obscure haptic urge. The little clutched hands hover gravely gathered at my temples, ready to strike, to sound the beat. What beat? The drum beat.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| A sunny day in September, my third birthday. Delicate, late summer glass- blowing, even Gretchen Schemer's laughter was subdued. ||| Mama at the piano intoning airs from The Gypsy Baron, Jan behind her at the stool, touching her shoulder, pretending to study the score. Matzerath getting supper ready in the kitchen.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'to give more context'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', None] ||| I would gladly have defended myself in more harmless and less miraculous ways, but nothing harmless would serve; glass alone heeded me, and had to pay the price. I made my first successful presentation of this sort shortly after my third birthday. ||| I 'd had my drum a good four weeks, and during that time, diligent as I was, had worn it out. True, the top and bottom were still joined by the cylinder of red and white flames, but the hole in the top that called the tune could no longer be ignored; and since I spurned the bottom, the hole grew bigger and bigger, frayed, and left sharp, jagged edges; tiny scraps of pounded tin splintered off and fell inside the drum, rattling about angrily at every stroke, while specks of white lacquer that could no longer endure life on my martyred drum glittered all over the living room rug and on the reddish brown planks of the bedroom floor.

This harness consisted of a pale blue knitted cord that served as a shaft. ||| Attached in six places to the right and left of this shaft were woolen bridles for a total of twelve kids. Bells dangled at six- inch intervals.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'even though'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| With children, including some of my own age, crowding about them, they reminded me of my uncle Vinzent's sow in Bissau, who sometimes flung herself on her side and endured the similarly brutal and thirsty assault of her piglets. The boys bent over the steadily collapsing towers of water in the basins, let their hair fall forward, and allowed the streams of water to poke about in their open mouths. ||| I don't know if they were playing or drinking.

Denied a worthwhile view by the insidious architecture, I simply stared at the sky and found pleasure in that. ||| One new cloud after another emigrated from northwest to southeast, as if that direction had something special to offer. I wedged my drum, though it had not spent one drumbeat thinking about emigration, between my knees and the desk drawer.
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'subsequently'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Outside the portals of the Pestalozzi School I took it from her and converted the schedule into a meaningless paper ball. But Oskar did allow the photographer, who was waiting between the columns at the entrance for the first graders with their paper cones and mothers, to take a picture of him with his own school cone, which, in spite of all the confusion, he had not lost. ||| The sun came out, classrooms buzzed above us. The photographer posed Oskar before a blackboard on which was written : My First Day at School. Rasputin and the ABCs
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I learned quickly and steadily without thinking much about it. Within a year I felt at home in Petersburg, in the private chambers of the autocratic ruler of all Russians, in the nursery of the sickly Tsarevich, among conspirators and popes, and not least as an eyewitness to Rasputin's orgies. ||| There was a tone to all this that appealed to me, and it all revolved around a central figure. You could see it too in the contempo rary engravings scattered throughout the book, showing a bearded Rasputin with eyes of coal among women in black stockings and little else.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Trees and bushes emerged here and there from the courtyards and advertised the season. Otherwise the courtyards indeed differed in size, but as far as rabbits and carpet beatings were concerned they all came from the same litter. ||| While there were rabbits throughout the year, carpets were, according to house rules, beaten only on Tuesdays and Fridays. On such days the size of the courtyard complex was confirmed.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| I shouldn't have run, I should have walked calmly. But because I ran, everyone who 'd been fishing around in the pot with their eyes till then looked up at me. ||| I heard Susi Kater's voice behind me saying, " He's going to rat on us, look at him run !"; her voice was still stabbing at me as I stumbled up four flights of stairs and finally caught my breath in the attic.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'in more detail'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Every Thursday Mama went shopping in the city.

They had spent scarcely an hour together. ||| She had accompanied him to the station and waited with him until he boarded the train. Ten days later she paid him a visit.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'specifically'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| And he was distressed that in a situation where a real man would instantly have known how to act, he was vacillating and therefore depriving the most beautiful moments he had ever experienced (kneeling at her bed and thinking he would not survive her death) of their meaning. He remained annoyed with himself until he realized that not knowing what he wanted was actually quite natural. ||| We can never know what to want, because, living only one life, we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come. Was it better to be with Tereza or to remain alone?  There is no means of testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| Ten years earlier, when he had divorced his wife, he celebrated the event the way others celebrate a marriage. He understood he was not born to live side by side with any woman and could be fully himself only as a bachelor. ||| He tried to design his life in such a way that no woman could move in with a suitcase. That was why his flat had only the one bed.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Could they have been hand in hand all night?  It was hard to believe. And while she breathed the deep breath of sleep and held his hand (firmly: he was unable to disengage it from her grip), the enormously heavy suitcase stood by the bed. ||| He refrained from loosening his hand from her grip for fear of waking her, and turned carefully on his side to observe her better. Again it occurred to him that Tereza was a child put in a pitch-daubed bulrush basket and sent downstream.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Level-of-detail', 'for example'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Tomas desired but feared them. Needing to create a compromise between fear and desire, he devised what he called 'erotic friendship'. ||| He would tell his mistresses: the only relationship that can make both partners happy is one in which sentimentality has no place and neither partner makes any claim on the life and freedom of the other. To ensure that erotic friendship never grew into the aggression of love, he would meet each of his long-term mistresses only at intervals.

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'the reasons isare that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| The moment he violated that clause of the contract, his other mistresses would assume inferior status and become ripe for insurrection. Accordingly, he rented a room for Tereza and her heavy suitcase. ||| He wanted to be able to watch over her, protect her, enjoy her presence, but felt no need to change his way of life. He did not want word to get out that Tereza was sleeping at his place: spending the night together was the corpus delicti of love.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', None] ||| She stood up and followed him out, squinting. She was naked beneath her short nightdress. ||| Her face was blank, expressionless, but she moved energetically.

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| It was like a platform in the theatre.

Hoping to alleviate the pain in her heart by pains of the flesh, she jabbed needles under her fingernails.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'this is why'] ||| ['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', None] ||| By chance she had come home without his realizing it. She was pouring something from a medicine bottle down her throat, and her hand shook so badly the glass bottle clicked against her teeth. ||| He pounced on her as if trying to save her from drowning. The bottle fell to the floor, spotting the carpet with valerian drops.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'despite this'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Her dreams recurred like themes and variations or television series. For example, she repeatedly dreamed of cats jumping at her face and digging their claws into her skin. ||| We need not look far for an interpretation: in Czech slang the word 'cat' means a pretty woman. Tereza saw herself threatened by women, all women.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'in short'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| In languages that form the word 'compassion' not from the root 'suffering' but from the root 'feeling',the word is used in approximately the same way, but to contend that it designates a bad or inferior sentiment is difficult. The secret strength of its etymology floods the word with another light and gives it a broader meaning: to have compassion (co-feeling) means not only to be able to live with the other's misfortune but also to feel with him any emotion - joy, anxiety, happiness, pain. ||| This kind of compassion (in the sense of soucit, wspó³czucie, Mitgefühl, medkänsla) therefore signifies the maximal capacity of affective imagination, the art of emotional telepathy. In the hierarchy of sentiments, then, it is supreme.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'bearing in mind that'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Was he genuinely incapable of abandoning his erotic friendships?  He was.

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| No one wanted the little mongrels, and his colleague was loath to kill them. Looking over the puppies, Tomas knew that the ones he rejected would have to die. ||| He felt like the president of the republic standing before four prisoners condemned to death and empowered to pardon only one of them. At last he made his choice: a bitch whose body seemed reminiscent of the German shepherd and whose head belonged to its Saint Bernard mother.
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| It was true: the general euphoria lasted no longer than the first week. The representatives of the country had been hauled away like criminals by the Russian army, no one knew where they were, everyone feared for the men's lives, and hatred for the Russians drugged people like alcohol. ||| It was a drunken carnival of hate. Czech towns were decorated with thousands of hand-painted posters bearing ironic texts, epigrams, poems, and cartoons of Brezhnev and his soldiers, jeered at by one and all as a circus of illiterates.  But no carnival can go on for ever.  In the meantime, the Russians had forced the Czech representatives to sign a compromise agreement in Moscow.

She had been silly enough to think that going abroad would change her.

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] ||| Seven years earlier, a complex neurological case happened to have been discovered at the hospital in Tereza's town. They called in the chief surgeon of Tomas's hospital in Prague for consultation, but the chief surgeon of Tomas's hospital happened to be suffering from sciatica, and because he could not move he sent Tomas to the provincial hospital in his place. ||| The town had several hotels, but Tomas happened to be given a room in the one where Tereza was employed. He happened to have had enough free time before his train left to stop at the hotel restaurant.

By most accounts, knowledge can be acquired in many different ways and from many sources, including but not limited to perception, reason, memory, testimony, scientific inquiry, education, and practice. The philosophical study of knowledge is called epistemology.

The philosopher Plato famously pointed out the need for a distinction between knowledge and true belief in the _ Theaetetus _, leading many to attribute to him a definition of knowledge as " justified true belief" .

A society can also consist of like- minded people governed by their own norms and values within a dominant, larger society. This is sometimes referred to as a subculture, a term used extensively within criminology, and also applied to distinctive subsections of a larger society.

This law, first proposed and tested by Émilie du Châtelet, means that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another. For instance, chemical energy is converted to kinetic energy when a stick of dynamite explodes. If one adds up all forms of energy that were released in the explosion, such as the kinetic energy and potential energy of the pieces, as well as heat and sound, one will get the exact decrease of chemical energy in the combustion of the dynamite. ||| Classically, conservation of energy was distinct from conservation of mass; however, special relativity showed that mass is related to energy and vice versa by _ E = mc 2 _, and science now takes the view that mass – energy as a whole is conserved. Theoretically, this implies that any object with mass can itself be converted to pure energy, and vice versa, though this is believed to be possible only under the most extreme of physical conditions, such as likely existed in the universe very shortly after the Big Bang or when black holes emit Hawking radiation.

A single semiconductor crystal can have many p- and n- type regions; the p – n junctions between these regions are responsible for the useful electronic behavior. ||| Using a hot- point probe, one can determine quickly whether a semiconductor sample is p- or n- type.

Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, providing structure to cells and organisms, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific 3D structure that determines its activity. A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide. ||| A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides.

The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit : " great- souled", " venerable"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world. Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, western India, Gandhi trained in law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. ||| After two uncertain years in India, during which he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 (to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit), where he stayed for 21 years. It was in South Africa that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights.
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| ['Unknown Relation', 'Unknown Relation', None] |||  Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a new Muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu- majority India and Muslim- majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Eschewing the official celebration of independence in Delhi, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to provide solace. In the months following, he undertook several fasts unto death to stop religious violence. The last of these, undertaken on 12 January 1948 when he was 78, also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan. Some Indians thought Gandhi was too accommodating. Among them was Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, who assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948 by firing three bullets into his chest. Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence. ||| Gandhi is commonly, though not formally, considered the Father of the Nation in India, and was commonly called Bapu (Gujarati : endearment for _ father _, _ papa _).

The water also contains salts of magnesium, calcium, potassium, and mercury, amongst many other elements, some in minute concentrations. Salinity varies widely, being lower near the surface and the mouths of large rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean; however, the relative proportions of dissolved salts vary little across the oceans. Winds blowing over the surface of the sea produce waves, which break when they enter the shallow water. Winds also create surface currents through friction, setting up slow but stable circulations of water throughout the oceans. The directions of the circulation are governed by factors, including the shapes of the continents and Earth's rotation (the Coriolis effect). Deep- sea currents, known as the global conveyor belt, carry cold water from near the poles to every ocean. ||| Tides, the generally twice- daily rise and fall of sea levels, are caused by Earth's rotation and the gravitational effects of the orbiting Moon and, to a lesser extent, of the Sun. Tides may have a very high range in bays or estuaries.
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'by comparison'] ||| ['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', None] |||  Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal- shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze- thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year- to- year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater. Major snow- prone areas include the polar regions, the northernmost half of the Northern Hemisphere and mountainous regions worldwide with sufficient moisture and cold temperatures. ||| In the Southern Hemisphere, snow is confined primarily to mountainous areas, apart from Antarctica.

Historians seek to understand and represent the past through narratives. They often debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects. Historians also debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing " perspective"on the problems of the present. Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends. ||| History differs from myth in that it is supported by evidence.
